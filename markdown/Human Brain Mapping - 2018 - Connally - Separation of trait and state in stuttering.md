Abstract

Stuttering is a disorder in which the smooth flow of speech is interrupted. People who stutter show

structural and functional abnormalities in the speech and motor system. It is unclear whether func-

tional differences reflect general traits of the disorder or are specifically related to the dysfluent

speech state. We used a hierarchical approach to separate state and trait effects within stuttering.

We collected sparse-sampled functional MRI during two overt speech tasks (sentence reading and

picture description) in 17 people who stutter and 16 fluent controls. Separate analyses identified indi-

cators of: (1) general traits of people who stutter; (2) frequency of dysfluent speech states in

subgroups of people who stutter; and (3) the differences between fluent and dysfluent states in peo-

ple who stutter. We found that reduced activation of left auditory cortex, inferior frontal cortex

bilaterally, and medial cerebellum were general traits that distinguished fluent speech in people who

stutter from that of controls. The stuttering subgroup with higher frequency of dysfluent states during

scanning (n 5 9) had reduced activation in the right subcortical grey matter, left temporo-occipital

cortex, the cingulate cortex, and medial parieto-occipital cortex relative to the subgroup who were

more fluent (n 5 8). Finally, during dysfluent states relative to fluent ones, there was greater activation

of inferior frontal and premotor cortex extending into the frontal operculum, bilaterally. The above

differences were seen across both tasks. Subcortical state effects differed according to the task.

Overall, our data emphasise the independence of trait and state effects in stuttering.

(Chang, Erickson, Ambrose, Hasegawa-Johnson, & Ludlow, 2008). Fur-

ther studies reported that the disorganisation extended into ventral

premotor cortex, bilaterally, and corresponded to abnormalities in func-

tional activation of nearby grey matter in adolescents and young adults

who stutter (Watkins, Smith, Davis, & Howell, 2008). In adults who

stutter, the right hemisphere disruptions underlying ventral premotor

tracts correspond to hyperactivity during imagined speech tasks in

fMRI and correlate with stuttering severity (Neef et al., 2017).

Previous work suggests differences follow a more diffuse pattern

of white matter disorganisation, with many disruptions occurring bilat-

erally (Connally, Ward, Howell, & Watkins, 2014). White matter was

disorganized in each of the four cerebral lobes, in the cerebral and cer-

ebellar peduncles, and within the posterior body of the corpus cal-

losum. Notably, descending motor pathways (corticobulbar tracts)

showed greater abnormality in the left hemisphere compared to the

right within people who stutter, whereas fluent controls showed no dif-

ferences between hemispheres in these pathways. Overall, abnormal-

ities have been documented in numerous white matter pathways in the

brains of individuals who stutter, and differences are especially pro-

nounced in the left hemisphere speech-motor pathways (Neef, Anwan-

der, & Friederici, 2015). It remains to be determined whether these

tracts are affected early or even before the onset of the disorder in

early childhood. Given that children who stutter show predominately

left-hemisphere disorganization (Chang et al., 2008),

it is likely that

some, if not all, of the microstructural differences observed in adults

who stutter relate to experience-dependent mechanisms that surface

throughout the duration of the disorder.

Direct comparisons of dysfluent to fluent speech states within individu-

als are rare. Of the four reports to do so (den Ouden, Montgomery, &

Adams, 2014; Jiang, Lu, Peng, Zhu, & Howell, 2012; Sowman, Crain,

Harrison, & Johnson, 2012; Wymbs, Ingham, Ingham, Paolini, & Graf-

ton, 2013) both fluent and dysfluent speech states recruited the same

fundamental network, which is consistent with findings in studies of

trait effects indicating similarities in activation are also far greater than

differences (Fox et al., 1996; Ingham, Grafton, Bothe, & Ingham, 2012).

Specific findings can loosely be grouped according to those showing

reduced recruitment of language-dominant inferior frontal cortex dur-

ing dysfluent speech (den Ouden et al., 2014; Sowman et al., 2012),

those studies showing increased recruitment of the speech-motor net-

work during dysfluent speech (Sowman et al., 2012; Wymbs et al.,

2013), and a single study reporting both these patterns of alterations

and suggesting they underlie different specific speech symptoms in

stuttering (Jiang et al., 2012). Within participants, both the basal ganglia

and cerebellum are associated with lower magnitude of signal change

during “more typical” relative to “less typical” stuttering symptoms

(Jiang et al., 2012). In other words, the “less typical” symptoms of stut-

tering (incomplete phrases, revisions, interjections, and phrase repeti-

tions) resulted in subcortical overactivity relative to “more typical”

symptoms (part-word repetitions, prolongations, broken words) (Jiang

et al., 2012). The distinction between specific symptoms within dysflu-

ent speech states suggests potential for dual-roles of the subcortical

motor structures in stuttering neuropathology. Further, the variability

in the specific location of state effects cannot be overstated, as only a

1.3 | The aims of the current study

Here, we used a whole-brain approach to explore speech-related activ-

ity during two speech production tasks—sentence reading and picture

description—as reflecting either general traits of stuttering or specific

states of stuttered speech. We defined trait and state effects in stutter-

ing as follows (Figure 1):

General Traits: Activity during fluent-speech production in people

who stutter (PWS) that differed from that in controls (CON).

State-based subgroups: We divided our sample of PWS, who all

share the stuttering trait, into two subgroups using a data-driven

threshold for fluency during scanning: one subgroup contained indi-

viduals who were mostly fluent (FLU) during scanning and the other

contained participants who were more dysfluent (DYS).

State effects: Within individuals in the DYS subgroup, we compared

fluent to dysfluent utterances to explore potential indicators of the

stuttering state.

Seventeen adults with persistent developmental stuttering (PWS: 13

males, 4 females; aged 19–54 years; 3 left-handers) and 17 age and

sex-matched fluent controls (CON: 13 males, 4 females; aged 19–

53 years; 3 left-handers) were scanned using functional MRI. All partici-

pants were native English speakers. No controls had a history or diag-

nosis of learning or speech disorders. All participants gave informed

consent to their participation in the research in a protocol approved by

University of Reading’s ethics committee. We removed one male con-

trol participant from this analysis because of noncompliance with

instructions (see “Speech tasks” below for details). Therefore, a total of

16 CON and 17 PWS were retained for analysis.

both PWS and CON, can be used to isolate a general trait of
stuttering. (b) In our study, about half of the PWS group
overlapped with CON in the average number of dysfluent
utterances per scan; the other half did not overlap with CON at all
in terms of frequency of dysfluent utterances. Therefore, we used
a data–driven threshold to create two subgroups of PWS: mostly
fluent (FLU) and somewhat dysfluent (DYS). These subgroups were
compared directly to isolate effects related to a general “proclivity”

Trio scanner with a 12-channel head coil. Whole head T2*-weighted

echo planar images (TE 5 30 ms) were acquired every 9 s with a silent

delay of 7 s (i.e., sparse sampling) and comprised 2-s acquisition of 32 4-

mm axial slices (in plane resolution 3 3 3 mm). A “1” appeared in the

middle of the screen during the 2-s acquisition period. During the 7-s

silent delay between measurements, participants saw a stimulus via scan-

ner compatible goggles that was a picture with a descriptive sentence

below it, or a picture with no text, or a “1” in the middle of the screen.

Participants were instructed to read the sentences aloud (Sentence

Reading task) or to overtly describe the pictures (Picture Description

task) and were explicitly told to stop speaking when the crosshair

appeared so that there would be no speech related movement of the

head during data collection. Prior to the scan, the task was explained to

participants, who were allowed to practise outside the scanner. Partici-

pants were explicitly instructed to refrain from using fluency enhance-

ment techniques in the scanner and to speak as naturally as possible.

For each of the tasks and the baseline, 40 volumes of data were

acquired for a total of 120 volumes (18 min); the order of tasks was

fixed and pseudorandom. Two runs were acquired in each participant,

yielding a total of 80 volumes of each task (Sentence Reading, Picture

Description) and baseline.

2.3 | Speech tasks

We use two tasks to elicit overt speech: (1) sentence reading and (2)

and is often comorbid with stuttering (Ward et al., 2015). Speech was

It is worth noting that the latter occur in the speech of normally fluent

speakers as well as in the speech of people who stutter, but do not

contribute towards calculations of stuttered syllables in the SSI.

The blinded ratings were compared to ratings from another native

threshold of Z > 2.3 and a cluster significance threshold of p < .05,

corrected for multiple comparisons. When the modelled main effects

or interactions did not reveal any significant differences at this cor-

rected threshold, we used an exploratory, uncorrected threshold of

p < .01 (Z > 2.3), with an additional constraint that the cluster size was

fluent (FLU, n 5 8), and the most dysfluent during scanning (DYS,

n 5 9). This analysis allowed us to isolate activations related to pro-

trait of stuttering. Both fluent and dysfluent sentences were retained

for this analysis. The analysis revealed significant task differences

The analysis revealed significant task differences across both fluent

frontal gyrus bilaterally, the right postcentral gyrus, the right parietal

operculum, the left superior temporal cortex, the medial occipital cor-

tex, and several portions of the cerebellum both medially and laterally.

These trait effects were predominantly due to greater activity during

task relative to baseline in the control group compared with the stut-

tering group (see Table 3). Several of these regions also showed

reduced activity in people who stutter in previous reports: inferior fron-

tal cortex (Neef et al., 2016; Watkins et al., 2008); left superior tempo-

ral

(auditory) cortex (e.g., Brown et al., 2005; Giraud et al., 2008;

Watkins et al., 2008;Toyomura et al., 2015;Budde et al., 2014); and

medial cerebellum (Chang, Kenney, Loucks, & Ludlow, 2009; Ingham

et al., 2012). However, our findings are notably inconsistent with the

broader claim that overactivity of the right inferior frontal cortex and

cerebellar vermis are “neural signatures” of stuttering (Brown et al.,

2005; Belyk et al., 2017; Budde et al., 2014).

It is possible that we did not see areas of overactivity in people

who stutter in our study because the analysis was restricted to only flu-

ent utterances. The overactivity of the right inferior frontal cortex, in

particular, has recently been described to reflect overactive inhibition

of speech responses (Neef et al,. 2016) that would occur most often

during the dysfluent state. Consistent with this interpretation is the

overactivity of the right inferior frontal cortex seen in the state analysis

for the dysfluent relative to the fluent state (see Figure 6).

The left inferior frontal cortex was underactive in our study, con-

target and error maps used to update internal speech plans (Guenther

& Ghosh, 2003; Tourville & Guenther, 2011). To summarize, our analy-

sis of fluent speech in people who stutter has revealed a pattern of

reduced activity relative to controls in a network of brain regions

thought to be critical for feedback-based speech monitoring. One ten-

tative interpretation of this pattern is that it reflects a compensatory

gating mechanism reducing signal throughout the feedback control sys-

tem, which in turn could counter an over-reliance on feedback that is

theorized to cause stuttering (Max, Guenther, Gracco, Ghosh, &

Wallace, 2004).

We also observed trait differences in the left lateral cerebellum in

subregions functionally connected to prefrontal cortex (e.g., left crus I)

(O’Reilly, Beckmann, Tomassini, Ramnani, & Johansen-Berg, 2010).

People who stutter showed negative signal change in the lateral cere-

bellum, while fluent controls showed positive activation relative to

baseline. Furthermore, trait-related activation in this region interacted

with task: fluent controls recruited this region to a greater extent for

picture description than for sentence reading, whereas people who

stutter did not. Similar effects were observed in this region during PET

imaging of longer speech utterances in people who stutter (Ingham

et al., 2012) and altered functional connectivity between the lateral

cerebellum and premotor cortex was also reported in stuttering (Lu

et al., 2010). Abnormal activity in the lateral cerebellum could reflect

maladaptive prediction processing related to speech and language plan-

ning (Sokolov, Miall, & Ivry, 2017). We speculate that during fluent

speech in people who stutter, abnormal activity in this region reflects a

successful compensatory mechanism involving disengagement. The

degree to which regions must disengage may be moderated by task

demands, which would explain the interaction between task and trait

in this study. A “disengagement” that resulted in compensation would

also be consistent with reports of increased baseline activation of the

cerebellum in people who stutter (Ingham et al., 2012). Future work is

needed to investigate the role of cerebellar activation at rest as it

relates specifically to trait and state effects in stuttering in order to bet-

ter clarify the nature of effects observed in our study.

not just in frequency but also type of speech dysfluency is an important

next step.

An alternative explanation of the observed greater activity in the

striatum in the fluent subgroup is that the activation is the result of the

fluent speech, not the cause. The logic can be simply stated as follows:

fluent speech is more rewarding than dysfluent speech for people who

stutter. The “expectation of success” for movements results in rewards

(e.g., boost of dopamine), and this function is processed in the striatum

in both hemi-

spheres the average signal change for the more dysfluent subgroup

relative to baseline observed in the fluent subgroup. The interpretation

of such “deactivations” relative to “activations” is not straightforward.

However, our findings could reflect a successful recruitment of the pla-

One of most common findings during both PET and fMRI imaging

of sequential speech in stuttering is overactivity of medial premotor cor-

tex (preSMA/SMA; Braun et al., 1997; Fox et al., 2000, 1996, Ingham

et al., 2012, 2000; Kell et al., 2009; Preibisch et al., 2003; Sakai et al.,

2009). Activation of medial premotor cortex is also related to stuttering

frequency and is theorized to reflect task effects in stuttering (Ingham

et al., 2012). The only nearby region showing activation differences in

our study was found inferior to the SMA complex, in the cingulate gyrus,

occurring bilaterally, which showed greater activity in the mostly fluent

subgroup. These differences appeared to be due to large, negative signal

change in the dysfluent subgroup, whereas the fluent subgroup showed

positive signal change relative to baseline in the left cingulate gyrus. The

basal ganglia are functionally connected to the medial frontal cortex in a

circuit thought to be involved in the preparation and execution of move-

ments (Cunnington, Windischberger, Deecke, & Moser, 2002). The sub-

group effect observed could reflect inefficient coordination of that

network via connections through the cingulate cortex.

Our study also adds to reports of significant relationships between

temporo-occipital cortex activation and the frequency of dysfluency in

stuttering (Brown et al., 2005; Fox et al., 2000; Giraud et al., 2008;

Ingham et al., 2004). We observed greater activity in visual association

Identification of state effects, specifically those associated with dysflu-

ency in people who stutter is of major importance. There is surprisingly

little data on this state (see Section 1), with many reports relying

instead on correlations with stuttering severity that might be better

described as “proclivity to stutter” and more akin to our frequency

analysis described above. The reason for the paucity of data on the

dysfluent state is due to the fact that it occurs relatively infrequently in

most individuals, particularly when in the scanning environment, which

also can be fluency enhancing. Obtaining a maximum of 160 utterances

during scanning in our study allowed us to compare a sufficient number

of fluent and dysfluent utterances (at least 10 of each in each run) in a

subgroup of 8 individuals. Within these individuals, we directly com-

pared activation during dysfluent speech states to that underlying flu-

ent speech states.

Activity was greater in the lateral inferior frontal and premotor cor-

tex, frontal operculum and anterior insula bilaterally during dysfluent

relative to fluent speech. Importantly, we further confirmed that these

effects were not related to head motion in the scanner, which did not

differ between these speech states. Our findings are largely consistent

with previous reports of overactivity in inferior frontal and premotor

cortex in stuttering (Braun et al., 1997; Ingham et al., 2012), including

in the central opercular cortex (Fox et al., 1996, 2000; Giraud et al.,

process seems to be the best explanation of this consistently

reported result (see Neef et al., 2016). This “stopping” response is

right lateralised even for inhibition of speech (Xue, Aron, & Poldrack,

2008). The left hemisphere overactivity of the same regions in the

dysfluent state requires a different explanation, therefore. This could

be compensatory or reflect the greater speech effort that comes

with the dysfluent state. Whatever the explanation, the symmetrical

pattern of overactivity during the dysfluent state of brain areas

involved in speech motor planning and execution and their right

hemisphere homologues is striking.

One notable unilateral state effect was observed in the right parie-

tal operculum. This was also the only region that indicated both state

and trait effects in our study. Activation was reduced in this region for

fluent speech states relative to dysfluent speech states, and in fluent

speech in people who stutter relative to fluent controls, across tasks.

Further, the stuttering group showed reduced activation of this region

relative to baseline during fluent speech, while the fluent controls

showed a positive signal change. The parietal operculum is thought to

house the secondary somatosensory cortex, with representations for

the face in addition to other body maps (Eickhoff, Schleicher, Zilles, &

speech sequence involving disrupted loops with inferior frontal regions

(Guenther & Ghosh, 2003). We observed the predicted net increase in

activity in inferior frontal regions during dysfluent states, and a net

decrease during fluent speech in stutterers relative to fluent controls in

nearby cortex, which would be consistent with a “disengage for flu-

ency” scenario. On the other hand, during sentence reading, the

decreased subcortical activity for dysfluent speech could reflect the

theorised delay in the putamen-SMA loop itself which results in insuffi-

cient “go” signals to initiate movements (Civier et al., 2013). Because

the putamen can play both inhibitory and excitatory roles through con-

nections (via the pallidum and thalamus) with the SMA and substantia

nigra for the planning of volitional movements, distinguishing between

these possibilities with imaging studies is not possible. Notably, a por-

tion of the right hemisphere pallidum showing the state by task interac-

tion was also associated with differences in the frequency of dysfluent

utterances between stuttering subgroups.

relative to that in controls. But, people who stutter who are more flu-

ent during scanning, showed a general pattern of overactivation rela-

tive to those who were dysfluent. In this case, the overactivation could

be considered causal to achieving fluency in the scanner in this rela-

tively fluent subgroup or, conversely, failure to activate these regions

in the dysfluent subgroup is the cause of their more frequent dysflu-

ency. In the state analysis, a different pattern emerged in a separate set

of brain regions. That is, brain areas were generally overactive in the

dysfluent state compared with the fluent state within people who stut-

ter. Here, the interpretation might be different to that above, and dif-

ferent for different brain regions. The overactivity could be considered

to cause the speech dysfluency, be the consequence of it (either as a

correlate of greater inhibition or error responses) or reflect an attempt

to overcome it. It would be possible to test some of these hypotheses

using interference techniques such as brain stimulation.

Overall, the distinctions in the brain areas involved in state and

trait analyses described here are somewhat consistent with the conclu-

sions of two meta-analyses attempting the same dissociation (Belyk

et al., 2017; Budde et al., 2014). There are notable differences also. For

example, only one brain region showed abnormal activation that indi-

cated both trait and state effects, namely the right parietal operculum,

which was underactive in people who stutter in the trait analysis and

overactive during dysfluency in the state analyses. Subcortically, activ-

ity in the right putamen/pallidum was associated with frequency of

dysfluent speech states, and also with the interaction between state

In this study, we used two tasks: picture description and sentence read-

ing. The amount of dysfluency occurring during these different tasks

was highly variable among stuttering individuals but did not consis-

tently differ on average across the group. The picture description task

involves generating speech content (i.e., cognitively and linguistically

selecting the semantic content, morphology, and syntactic frame for a

sentence). In contrast, sentence reading does not involve these proc-

esses and instead requires the reader to produce prescribed speech

content, which means that words cannot be avoided or substituted.

Such strategies are commonly employed by people who stutter to

avoid “difficult” words on which they predict dysfluency. Both tasks

require retrieval and production of the phonology and articulatory

processes for speaking either the provided or the self-generated sen-

tence that are arguably matched.

The imaging data for these tasks shows very similar networks of

activity in lateral and medial cortical areas involving left inferior frontal

cortex, the ventral premotor and sensorimotor cortex, the SMA com-

plex on the medial surface, the superior temporal cortex and occipital

cortex, bilaterally (see Figure 3). The additional cognitive and linguistic

effort required by the picture description task relative to the sentence

reading one led to the expected greater activation of the brain network

of areas involved in these tasks. In particular, as evident in Figure 3,

picture description activates the left inferior frontal cortex to a greater

extent than does sentence reading, presumably reflecting the additional

requirements for lexical search and retrieval and generation of the syn-

and task. Furthermore, we observed that abnormal activation of sub-

4.6 | Methodological considerations

In this study, we implemented some data acquisition approaches aimed

at clarifying state and trait effects in stuttering imaging research. Overt

speech production during the two tasks was recorded for off-line anal-

ysis. This allowed us to assess compliance of all participants with task

performance as well as evaluating dysfluency during scanning. To our

surprise, some participants (controls and people who stutter) were not

compliant with task instructions and introduced unexpected behavior.

In some cases, whole datasets were eliminated from analyses. In other,

less severe cases, stimuli could be reallocated to the correct task or

individual epochs removed from analysis. This approach ensured

greater accuracy in our analyses.

In addition, the in-scanner recordings allowed us to determine

which utterances contained speech dysfluency and which were fluent.

Trial-by-trial precision enabled an accurate trait analysis of fluent

speech in the whole group and a state analysis in the subgroup of peo-

ple who were dysfluent during scanning. Nevertheless, this analysis

was limited in that we only examined activation following a speech

event, and it could be the case that an error signal detected before tri-

als gives us a causal indicator of dysfluent states. Use of real-time fMRI

during the dysfluent state may be informative in terms of determining

whether brain activity is compensatory, reflecting error detection, or

part of an inhibitory response. Furthermore, we did not distinguish

between typical or atypical dysfluencies within our state analysis (Jiang

the potential for head movements to occur more frequently during the

dysfluent state, we compared the degree to which each image acquisi-

tion needed to be corrected for motion in those images that followed

fluent and dysfluent utterances and the number of motion outliers that

were detected in each state. There were no significant differences

between the two states in either of these measures, allowing us to con-

clude that motion artefacts related to speech dysfluency have not con-

taminated our data.

Finally, by implementing two different tasks, we were able to explore

whether the patterns of abnormal brain activity seen in trait and state

analyses vary depending on the task. We found limited, but some evi-

dence for this effect. It would be interesting to explore this further with a

greater range of speaking tasks, including natural and induced speech flu-

ency, as well as spontaneous and imitated speech dysfluencies.

C O N C L U S I O N

We conclude that indicators of traits, states, and relative frequency

of dysfluency in stuttering are potentially spatially-separable factors.

Furthermore, we showed that task demands can influence these

effects. In particular, task demands might explain the complex role

played by subcortical control structures in stuttering and speech

production more broadly. Overall, our findings support efforts to dis-

tinguish state and trait effects directly within a study sample, and

provide evidence of subgroups of people who stutter who differ in

frequency of dysfluent speech in the scanner. The results point to
