Objectives: The anticipation of stuttering is a common experience for many people who stutter. In this study,
subjective ratings of stuttering anticipation were used to investigate the consistency of anticipation across
time, beliefs about how anticipation affects the likelihood of stuttering, and the relationship between
anticipation and verbal response time (VRT) in the perceptually fluent speech of 12 adults who stutter (AWS).
Method: AWS used a visual analog scale to rate their beliefs about stuttering anticipation in general, and their
degree of stuttering anticipation for 50 words at two separate visits that were separated by approximately 1
week. Participants performed a computer-prompted oral reading task with the same 50 words to obtain
measures of VRT. Within-subject and group level correlations were used to explore relationships between
stuttering anticipation, VRT, and stuttering severity.
Results: Six of the participants had word-level stuttering anticipation ratings that were significantly correlated
across the two testing visits. Two participants with the highest stuttering severity showed a positive correlation
between word-level stuttering anticipation and VRT. Across the group, stuttering severity was positively
correlated with the belief that the anticipation of stuttering increases the likelihood of stuttering, and the
consistency of word level anticipation ratings across time.
Conclusion: The results provide evidence for a relationship between stuttering severity, the consistency of
anticipation, and the belief
that anticipating stuttering increases the likelihood of stuttering. The
relationship between anticipation and VRT in two of the most severe participants provides preliminary
evidence that anticipation may be able to subtly influence the speech production system.

Introduction
Stuttering is a speech disorder that affects the smooth
production of speech and is expressed in repetitions,
prolongations, and ‘blocking’ of speech sounds that
can severely impact communication. It is estimated
that 1% of the general population stutters (Bloodstein
and Ratner, 2008). People who stutter often experience
significant psychosocial repercussions such as being
bullied, an increased risk of social anxiety, decreased
vocational opportunities, and decreased overall life sat-
isfaction (Blood et al., 2007; Blumgart et al., 2010). One
of the hallmarks of stuttering that may relate to the psy-
chosocial aspects of stuttering is the ability of the
speaker to predict a moment or instance of stuttering
prior to producing the actual disruption of speech.

This experience is referred to as stuttering anticipation,
or expectancy, and for many years the validity and rel-
evance of the phenomenon have been discussed in both
research and clinical reports.

The prevalence and pervasiveness of stuttering
anticipation in adults who stutter (AWS) was recently
demonstrated in a qualitative study by Jackson et al.
(2015). They observed that in a group of 30 AWS,
all reported experiencing stuttering anticipation at
‘sometimes’ and over three-fourths reported
least
experiencing it ‘often’ or ‘always’. Of note is that
while their study supports the universality of stuttering
anticipation, Jackson et al. did not observe a signifi-
cant relationship between the frequency of experien-
cing stuttering anticipation and stuttering severity
for their participants. This finding is taken to suggest
that anticipation is a group phenomenon at the same
stuttering
time as

anticipation differs across individuals with regard to
how and when it is elicited (Bloodstein and Ratner,
2008).

The nature and within-group variability of stutter-
ing anticipation is described well in a recent theoretical
model by Garcia-Barrera and Davidow (2015) that
uses learning accounts to propose specific mechanisms
and neural substrates underlying the phenomenon.
They hypothesized that the acquisition of stuttering
anticipation is linked to one’s experience with stutter-
ing over time, through a combination of reoccurrence
(the same words or sounds are consistently stuttered
over time), and valance tagging (the emotions that
accompany moments of stuttering reinforce an associ-
ation between stimuli and stuttering). Earlier evidence
supporting this developmental perspective comes
partly from Bloodstein’s (1960) cross-sectional study
in which he observed a progressive increase in the per-
centage of children that anticipate stuttering, from
38% at 8–9 years to 71% at 14–16 years of age.
Relatedly, De Nil and Brutten (1991) observed that
negative attitudes about talking and stuttering also
increased with age for children who stutter, and pro-
posed that this increase is related to the development
of more frequent and consistent stuttering behavior
and related anticipation.

Historically prominent theories of stuttering etiol-
ogy are rooted in anticipation, with the notion that
the behavioral manifestations of stuttering are reac-
tions to cues that signal an impending disfluency (see
Bloodstein and Ratner, 2008, Chap. 7 for review).
While anticipation is the common factor across
several of these theories, they differ in their expla-
nation of the mechanism that links the expectancy to
stutter with the moment of stuttering itself. For
example,
in his Anticipation-Avoidance Theory,
Johnson (1959) proposed that the anticipation of stut-
tering leads to an ‘apprehensive, hypertonic avoidance
response’ characterized by hesitation and disruption in
speech. Perhaps the most well-known theory of stutter-
ing rooted in the anticipation phenomenon is
Bloodstein’s (1975) Anticipatory Struggle Hypothesis
in which he argued that stuttering anticipation leads
to increased levels of muscle tension and subsequent
disruption of
the planned utterance. In contrast,
Wingate (1975) proposed that anticipation does not
contribute to the likelihood of stuttering, rather it is
a sense in which something has already gone awry
with the speech production system. Wingate (1975)
presented evidence of a weak relationship between
anticipation and actual stuttering, showing that AWS
often anticipate stuttering on words that they do not
actually stutter on and they stutter on words that
they do not anticipate.

We propose that the mechanism whereby antici-
pation elicits or co-varies with stuttering can best be

viewed from a multifactorial perspective in which (1)
including antici-
a complex interaction of factors,
pation, influence the likelihood of stuttering, and (2)
speech fluency is viewed along a continuum where
stuttering emerges when these factors exceed a variable
threshold for speech disruption. This orientation stems
from an integration of theoretical positions and several
lines of research, including the work of Alm (2014),
Namasivayam and Van Lieshout (2011), and Smith
and Kelly (1997), among others. Although it is not
clear exactly how emotional or anticipatory factors
are capable of influencing speech production, the
Speech and Monitoring Interaction (SAMI) frame-
work of stuttering provides a biologically plausible
explanation for the contextual variability of stuttering
and the subtle influences that social, emotional, and
anticipatory factors may have on fluent speech pro-
duction (for a full description of SAMI see Arenas,
in press). Within SAMI, the efficiency of speech pro-
duction, and ultimately fluency,
is the result of
factors that influence both the speech production
system and a domain general monitoring system
(Dehaene et al., 1994; Luu et al., 2000; Nozari et al.,
2011). The monitoring system is able to directly
affect speech output by initiating cognitive and inhibi-
tory control processes (Alexander and Brown, 2010;
Botvinick, 2007; Botvinick et al., 2001; Bush et al.,
2000; Danielmeier et al., 2011), and the magnitude
of the influence from the monitoring system is modu-
lated by social (Cavanagh and Allen, 2008), emotional
(Hajcak et al., 2003a, 2004) and anticipatory (Brown
and Braver, 2005; Dunning and Hajcak, 2007) factors.
Several studies have investigated the relationship
between anticipatory/emotional factors and stutter-
ing. For example, Bowers et al. (2012) examined the
relationship between the subjective experience of
anticipation and moments of stuttering in AWS. In
this study, the authors tested the hypothesis that
increased cognitive anticipation, determined by
‘fear’ of stuttering on specific
subject ratings of
words, would be correlated to increased amounts of
autonomic nervous system (ANS) arousal and stutter-
ing frequency. Analysis revealed a significant positive
relationship between anticipation and ANS arousal,
but not between anticipation and perceptually appar-
ent moments of stuttering. This latter observation
was corroborated by Jackson et al. (2015), who also
found no relationship between self-reports of more
generalized (i.e., not word-specific) anticipation and
stuttering severity in individuals who stutter. The
lack of a strongly observed relationship between stut-
tering anticipation and actual stuttering (Bowers
et al., 2012; Martin and Haroldson, 1967; Wingate,
1975), may be due to an additive or interactive effect
between anticipation and other factors that result in
the likelihood of stuttering. Given that there may be

a complex interaction of factors that lead to instances
of stuttering, it would be advantageous to study the
influence of anticipation on perceptually fluent
speech production in order to detect subtle effects
that influence the speech production system and may
increase the likelihood of stuttering.

Recent studies have investigated the relationship
between emotional stimuli and perceptually fluent
speech production in people who stutter. Hennessey
et al. (2014) used an Emotional Stroop task, which
compares verbal response time (VRT)
in neutral
word to ‘threat’ word trials, and found that AWS had
slower VRT on ‘threat’ compared to neutral words.
They also observed that the ‘emotionality effect’ was
correlated with stuttering severity. Van Lieshout et al.
found similar results to Hennessey et al.
(2014)
(2014), in that AWS showed slower VRTs for stuttering
specific threat words, especially those related to speak-
ing situations (e.g., audience, interview), compared to
neutral words. Arenas and Zebrowski (2013) studied
the relationship between ANS arousal and speech pro-
duction by utilizing a classical conditioning paradigm
to experimentally manipulate the anticipation of an
aversive stimulus (loud noise presented through head-
phones). They found several positive and significant
correlations between ANS arousal, as measured by
skin conductance, and both frequency and temporal
acoustic measures from fluent single-words produced
by AWS. The results showed that as ANS arousal
increased, F0, voice onset time and frication duration
also increased. Taken together, these studies demon-
strated that emotional reactivity secondary to exper-
imenter selected ‘threat stimuli’, or experimentally
induced anticipatory arousal, can affect speech pro-
duction in AWS.

to manipulate emotional, or

The purpose of this study was threefold. First, we
wanted to explore the relationship between the
strength or degree of word-specific stuttering antici-
pation and speech production in AWS, as measured
by VRT in an oral word reading task. Based on pre-
investigations that used word-
vious experimental
level stimuli
threat
context (Hennessey et al., 2014; Van Lieshout et al.,
2014) and based on predictions from the SAMI frame-
work (Arenas, in press), we predicted that there would
be significant positive within-subject correlations
between word-specific anticipation ratings and VRT,
due to increased motor inhibition of the speech pro-
duction process. Second, we wanted to examine the
consistency of anticipation by collecting word-specific
anticipation ratings at two separate time points. We
predicted that that there would be significant positive
within-subject
correlations between word-specific
anticipation ratings across time, providing evidence
that anticipation is consistently evoked by specific
cues (e.g., words) for individual persons who stutter.

Finally, we wanted to study the relationship between
AWS’ general beliefs about anticipation and consist-
ency of word-specific anticipation ratings across
time, stuttering severity, and VRT in orally read
single words. To accomplish this latter aim, we
designed a five item questionnaire to assess partici-
pants’ degree of stuttering anticipation across contexts,
and their beliefs regarding the influence that antici-
pation has on increasing the likelihood of stuttering.

Method
Participants
Participants were 12 AWS (five females), ranging from
18 to 41 years of age (M = 27; SD = 6.6). Descriptive
information about individual participants is presented
in Table 1. All participants were self-described people
who stutter, reported that they first began stuttering in
childhood, and indicated no known history of neuro-
logical, speech/language, or learning delay or disorder
(aside from stuttering). All participants reported that
they received treatment for stuttering at least one
time in their life. Participants received a score of 10
or higher on the Stuttering Severity Instrument-3
(SSI-3) (Riley, 1994) (M = 23.9; SD = 9.8). Measures
type and duration were
of
obtained from recorded spontaneous speech and oral
reading samples, and used to derive stuttering severity
via the SSI-3. Each of the participants read and signed
informed consent to participate in the present study.
All 12 participants were paid volunteers, who were
recruited from the Iowa City, IA and Albuquerque,
NM areas. The Institutional Review Boards of the
Iowa and the University of New
University of
Mexico approved this study’s protocol.

Procedures
The study consisted of two visits. Every attempt was
made to schedule the visits between 5 and 10 days
apart, but several timing constraints precluded this
for all participants. As a result, visits were scheduled
between 4 and 16 days apart (M = 8.5; SD = 3.7).
During the first visit, participants completed the

and oral reading samples. These two speech tasks
were used to derive the SSI-3 score. At the second
visit, the participants again rated each of 50 stimulus
words with regard to their anticipation of stuttering.
Following this,
they participated in a computer-
assisted oral reading task (50 words). For the oral

Anticipation of Stuttering Questionnaire
In order to assess the extent to which participants
experienced anticipation to stuttering across a range
of contexts (e.g., speaking to specific people, produ-
cing particular speech sounds or words, and so
forth), we created a five item questionnaire, hereafter
referred to as the ASQ. In addition to rating specific
contexts, we developed these five statements to deter-
mine the extent to which participants believed that
anticipation affected the likelihood that they would
(1) I sometimes
stutter. The statements included:
anticipate that I will stutter on words before I say
them, (2) I consistently anticipate stuttering on par-
ticular words, (3) There are certain sounds that I
anticipate stuttering on more than other sounds, (4) I
anticipate stuttering more when speaking to certain
people or in certain situations, and (5) I believe that
anticipating that I am going to stutter increases the
likelihood that I will stutter. The participants used a
computer mouse to slide a bar along a line that rep-
resented a continuum of agreement, with the far left
representing ‘strongly disagree’ and the far right repre-
senting ‘strongly agree’ with the statement. The place-
ment of the slider equated to a continuous value from
0 to 100, with zero corresponding to ‘strongly disagree’
and 100 corresponding to ‘strongly agree’. Table 1 pro-
vides individual agreement ratings for the five state-
ments. Fig. 1 shows a screenshot from the computer
program that was used for data collection of the ASQ.

Ratings of word-level anticipation
A set of 50 words was used in this study to assess word-
level stuttering anticipation across time, and the
relationship between degree of anticipation and

VRT. The words were selected from the English
Lexicon Project (ELP) database (Balota et al., 2007).
The ELP provides descriptive data (mean, standard
deviation, and z-scores) for VRT from oral reading
tasks for over 40 000 words across 1200 subjects,
along with the lexical properties of these words. For
the present study, we used the following procedure to
select 50 words that were similar in VRT and lexical
properties. First, we selected words with VRT z-scores
between −0.5 and 0.5 so that the stimuli would reflect
a typical range of verbal response; this resulted in a
set of 12 205 words. Next, to control for lexical and
orthographic factors, only words that were (1) six to
eight letters long, (2) possessed a word frequency log
score from 2.75 to 4.25, and (3) contained four to
seven phonemes, were chosen. This resulted in a set of
428 words. From this subset, 50 words were selected
with a range of initial phonemes to represent different
places and manners of articulation. Table 2 provides
the details of the lexical properties of the 50 words.

Participants rated the degree to which they expected
to stutter on each of the 50 words in the stimulus set.
The instructions for the rating process were presented
on the computer screen and the participant read the
instructions prior to beginning the task. Orthographic
representations of the 50 words were presented on a
computer monitor in sets of five. Ratings of degree of
anticipation were indicated by using a mouse to slide
a bar along a line that represented a continuum of
anticipation, with far left representing ‘no expectation
of stuttering’ on the particular word and the far
right representing ‘high expectation of stuttering’ on
the word. The placement of the slider equated to a
continuous value from 0 to 100, with zero being ‘no
expectation’ and 100 being ‘high expectation’. When
participants finished rating all
five words on the
screen, they clicked to the next screen and rated the

next five words, until they rated all 50 words across ten
pages. Fig. 2 shows a screenshot from the computer
program that was used for data collection of the
word-level anticipation ratings.

Verbal response time
VRT was measured from participant productions of
single words displayed on a computer screen. The
words that were presented were the same 50 words
that were used in the anticipation rating task described
previously. During the task, each of the 50 words were
randomly presented four times for a total of 200 trials.
Trials began with a mouse click by the participant.
After a 1.5 seconds pause, a fixation point appeared
in the center of the screen and remained for 0.9
seconds,
immediately followed by an audible tone
that occurred simultaneously with the visual presen-
tation of the word in the middle of the screen. The
word remained on the screen until the participant
said the word aloud, or until 2 s had elapsed. There
was an inter-trial
interval of 1.5 seconds before a
visual cue on the screen prompted the participants to
click the mouse to begin the next trial. This self-
pacing allowed the participants to take short breaks
if necessary to decrease fatigue. The participants
were instructed to read each word that appeared on
the screen as quickly as possible and not to use any

or

speech
strategies.
stuttering modification
Participant responses were audio recorded, with a
digital voice recorder and table microphone placed
to the computer monitor, and audio–video
next
recorded using a digital video recorder that was also
placed next to the computer monitor. VRT measures
were made manually by the first author using Praat
acoustic analysis software (Boersma and Weenink,
2012). VRT was operationally defined as the duration
of the interval between the onset of the tone that
occurred simultaneously with the stimulus word pres-
indication of acoustic
entation and the first visual
energy in the waveform associated with speech
initiation. Manual measurement of VRT avoids the
effects of nonspeech sounds and is more accurate
than a voice-activated relay in detecting weak sound
onsets like fricatives (Sakuma et al., 1997).

Trials produced with any perceptually apparent dis-
fluencies, misarticulations, or incorrect word pro-
ductions, were excluded from the analysis. Of the
2200 trials that were recorded, 234 were excluded
from the analysis due to incorrect word pronunciation
(15 trials) or presence of disfluencies (219 trials). Most
of the disfluencies were produced from three partici-
pants. Participant 101 stuttered on 28 out of 200
trials (14%), participant 104 stuttered on 100 out of
200 trials (50%), and 110 stuttered on 75 out of 150

trials (50%). For each participant, the median VRT
was used to represent their VRT for each word. We
used median VRT in order to reduce the influence of
potential outliers (Chau et al., 2005). All possible
median VRT measures (i.e., all 50 stimulus words)
were obtained for nine participants, while participant
101 contributed 49 median VRT measures and
participants 104 and 110 contributed 36 to the
analysis. These three participants did not have
median VRT values for words that were disfluent on
all trials.

Data analysis
Within-subject analyses
Non-parametric Spearman’s rho correlations were
used in all analyses due to the lack of normal distri-
bution throughout the subject ratings of anticipation.
Correlations were calculated separately for each par-
ticipant in order to examine the relationship between
(1) consistency of word-level stuttering anticipation
ratings at visit one and visit two, and (2) VRT and
word-level anticipation ratings. Each of these analyses
yielded a correlation coefficient for each participant

Group level analyses
Non-parametric Spearman’s rho correlation analyses
were planned to investigate relationships between stut-
tering severity, ASQ ratings, and (1) consistency of
anticipation rating across time, and (2) relationship
between VRT and word-level anticipation ratings.
We used an alpha level of 0.05 as our threshold for
statistical significance, and given the small sample
size and the exploratory nature of the study we did
not perform a Bonferroni correction (Nakagawa,
2004).

Test of stimuli equivalence
One of our goals was to select words that would yield
similar VRTs across participants. Thus, variations in
VRT that were correlated with anticipation ratings
could be interpreted with greater validity. Likewise,
we chose words with varying initial phonemes, with
the assumption that there would be relative equal
levels of stuttering anticipation across words at the
group level, (Bowers et al., 2012). This assumption is
based on the notion that stuttering anticipation is idio-
syncratic and rooted in the unique experiences of the
individual (Garcia-Barrera and Davidow, 2015). To
test the equivalence of VRT and stuttering anticipation
across words, one-way ANOVA analyses were exe-
cuted with words as the fixed factor, and median
VRT and mean anticipation ratings for each word
(from visit one and visit two) as dependent variables.

Reliability
Interjudge reliability for VRT was assessed by having a
second researcher (a graduate assistant) analyze com-
plete VRT data sets from two participants (a total of
400 trials). This accounted for 21.1% of the total
trials used in the analysis. The correlation coefficient
between the original and the remeasured VRT was
r = 0.97.

Anticipation of Stuttering Questionnaire
The average response to the five statements in the ASQ
across all the participants are represented as the pos-
ition of the slider in Fig. 1. For statement 1 (I some-
times anticipate that I will stutter on words before I
say them), there was strong agreement with the state-
indicating that, as a

group, there was some level of stuttering anticipation.
For statement 2 (I consistently anticipate stuttering on
particular words), there was high agreement across
the group (M = 74.2; SD = 28.0), indicating that, as
a group, anticipation is greater on specific words.
For statement 3 (There are certain sounds that I antici-
pate stuttering on more than other sounds), the average
group response was neutral (M = 64.9; SD = 32.7)
with a high level of group variability. For statement

3 was correlated with ASQ statement 5 (rs [12] =
0.866, P < 0.001), showing a relationship between
sound-specific anticipation and the belief that antici-
pation increases the likelihood of stuttering.

Consistency of word-level anticipation ratings
from visit one to visit two
Spearman’s rho correlation analyses were conducted
for each participant individually to test the consistency
of word-level anticipation ratings from visit one and
visit two. One participant (112) was able to attend
one visit only, and these data were removed from the
analysis. The correlation coefficients for the remaining
11 participants are provided in Table 1. Six partici-
pants had a statistically significant positive corre-
lation. These correlations indicate that for six out of
the 11 participants (55%), word-level anticipation
ratings were highly consistent across two separate
visits that were on average over 1 week apart. At the
group level, consistency of anticipation ratings across
time was significantly correlated with stuttering sever-
ity (rs [11] = 0.700, P = 0.016) (see Fig. 5), indicating
that participants with higher stuttering severity were
more consistent in the degree to which they anticipated
stuttering on specific words. There was also a signifi-
cant correlation between anticipation consistency
toward specific words, and ASQ statement 3 (rs [11]
= 0.633, P = 0.037), showing a relationship between
sound-specific and word-specific anticipation.

Relationship between word-specific stuttering
anticipation and VRT
Spearman’s rho correlation analyses were conducted for
each participant individually to test the relationship
between word-level VRT and their mean anticipation
ratings for each word. The correlation coefficients for
all participants are provided in Table 1. Two partici-
pants had a statistically significant positive correlation,
104 (rs [36] = 0.350, P = 0.036) and 108 (rs [50] =
0.375, P = 0.007). These correlations indicate that for
these two participants, their VRTs were slower for
words that they rated as having higher levels of stutter-
ing anticipation. Stuttering severity was close to being
significantly correlated at the group level with the
within-subject correlation coefficient representing the
relationship between VRT and word-level stuttering
anticipation (rs [12] = 0.559, P = 0.059). However,
besides not reaching a level of significance, this result
should be interpreted with caution since it is driven pri-
marily by the two most severe AWS that had the signifi-
cant correlation between VRT and anticipation ratings.

Relationship between stuttering and
word-specific anticipation ratings
In the oral word reading task, each word was produced
multiple times, allowing for a continuous variable of
the number of times a word was stuttered. Most par-
ticipants were fluent during the task, but participants
104 and 110 were both disfluent on 50% of the trials
in the oral word reading task. A post hoc Spearman’s
rho correlation analysis was conducted between
word-level stuttering anticipation ratings and the

number of times a word was stuttered throughout the
task. There was a significant positive correlation for
two participants (104 (rs [50] = 0.644, P < 0.001) and
110 (rs [50] = 0.375, P = 0.008)), indicating that for
these individuals, the words with higher anticipation
ratings were also more likely to be stuttered.

Stimuli equivalence
To test for equivalence in VRT and anticipation
ratings across the word stimuli set, individual one-
way ANOVA analyses were executed with words as
the fixed factor and median VRT from each word
and mean anticipation ratings for each word for each
participant as the dependent variables. There was no
[F(49 521) =
significant difference between words
0.372, P = 1.0] for VRT, indicating that across the
group there was equivalence with regard to VRT
among the words in this stimulus set. There was a sig-
nificant difference among words [F(49 550) = 1.43,
P = 0.033] for anticipation ratings,
indicating that
across the group there was not equivalence with
regard to degree of stuttering anticipation across the
words in the stimulus set. Subsequent analysis revealed
that the 27 words with the lowest average anticipation
ratings contained no words beginning with a stop
plosive, while 17 of the 23 words with the highest
average anticipation ratings began with a stop
plosive. Based on this observation a post hoc t-test
analysis was conducted comparing the word-level
anticipation ratings of words that begin with plosives
(n = 17) to the anticipation ratings of non-plosive
words (n = 33). The test revealed a significant differ-
ence [t(48) = 9.77, P < 0.001], indicating that across
the group plosives had significantly greater stuttering
anticipation ratings (M = 53.1, SD = 4.5) compared
to non-plosive words (M = 39.7, SD = 4.6).

Discussion
The purpose of this study was to explore the subjective
nature and consistency of stuttering anticipation and
how anticipation correlates with the efficiency of the
speech production system, as measured by VRT in
an oral word reading task. Visual analog scales were
used to assess the degree of stuttering anticipation
across contexts, beliefs about the influence of stutter-
ing anticipation on the likelihood of stuttering, and
anticipation ratings
individual words. Those
same words were used in a word reading task to test
the hypothesis that there would be a positive within-
subject correlation between stuttering anticipation
and VRT.

for

There were several main findings from this study.
First, the ASQ results provide evidence that the antici-
pation of stuttering is a salient characteristic of chronic
stuttering, and that stuttering severity is related to both
the specificity of anticipation (e.g., on specific sounds)

and the belief that anticipation increases the likelihood
of stuttering. Second, more than half of the partici-
pants showed significant consistency in word-level
stuttering anticipation ratings across a span of
approximately 1 week. There was also a significant
relationship between the anticipation consistency and
stuttering severity. Third,
the participants
with the most severe stuttering exhibited a significant
positive correlation between word-level
stuttering
anticipation ratings and VRT associated with percep-
tually fluent words, indicating that those words that
were more highly anticipated to be stuttered were
associated with slower response times.

two of

Subjective ratings of stuttering anticipation
The results from the ASQ support previous evidence
that anticipation is a salient characteristic of chronic
stuttering (Jackson et al., 2015). All of the AWS in
the study indicated that they anticipate stuttering at
least some of the time (ASQ question 1). As a group,
stuttering anticipation on specific words was a
common response (ASQ question 2). All but one par-
ticipant indicated that they anticipate stuttering more
when talking to certain people or certain situations
(ASQ question 4). Owing to the consistent group
level responses to ASQ questions 1, 2, and 4, these
responses were not correlated with stuttering severity.
Despite the relatively small sample size of this study
and the limited number of questions in the ASQ, our
interpretation of these results is that some level of stut-
tering anticipation, with increased anticipation to par-
ticular words and in particular situations, is likely a
common attribute of AWS. This interpretation is in
agreement with several studies indicating that stutter-
ing anticipation is common in adults and children
who stutter (Bloodstein, 1960; Jackson et al., 2015).

There was a strong relationship between stuttering
severity and the degree of sound-specific stuttering
anticipation. This
relationship can be explained
through the consistent reoccurrence of stuttering on
words that begin with similar phonemes, as described
in detail in a model by Garcia-Barrera and Davidow
(2015). People with more severe stuttering have more
disfluencies compared to those who are less severe
and hence have more opportunities to acquire the
anticipation of stuttering on specific sounds. Research
suggests that, as a group, AWS stutter more frequently
on consonants than vowels (for a review see Bloodstein
and Ratner, 2008, p. 253). It has been suggested that
consonants may be stuttered more frequently because
they are more motorically complex than vowels, requir-
ing more articulatory tension and precise timing. On a
continuum of vocal tract constriction, plosives are on
the extreme end of consonants compared to vowels in
which the vocal tract is relatively less constricted and
air flow is continuous. Our results showing that, as a

group, words that began with plosives had higher antici-
pation ratings compared to words that begin with non-
plosive phonemes, fits well with the idea that conso-
nants, with plosives being on the extreme end of the
spectrum, elicit greater stuttering anticipation because
of the more frequent occurrence of stuttering. The cor-
relation between stuttering severity and sound-specific
stuttering anticipation found in this study highlights
how increased frequency of stuttering may sharpen
the resolution of anticipation allowing for more detailed
patterns of anticipation to emerge (e.g., sound-specific
anticipation).

There was also a strong and significant relationship
between stuttering severity and the belief that antici-
pation increases the likelihood that stuttering will
occur. The belief that anticipation can lead to, or pre-
cipitate, increased stuttering is at the core of the quand-
‘Stuttering is what you
ary that Johnson describes,
do trying not to stutter’ (1972, p. 22). This idea of a
self-fulfilling prophecy is difficult to reconcile with the
data showing that stuttering frequently occurs in the
absence of anticipation (Wingate, 1975). However,
from the perspective that stuttering is precipitated
by a number of factors (linguistic and speech motor
demands, as well social/emotional
factors), antici-
pation should be viewed as a single contributing
factor that may or may not co-occur or precipitate stut-
tering depending on the milieu of other factors.

the anticipation of

Consistency of word-level stuttering anticipation
Word-level stuttering anticipation ratings were signifi-
cantly consistent across 1 week in six out of 11 AWS.
The consistency of anticipation across time demon-
strates the degree to which stuttering anticipation is a
long-term representation of cues (e.g., words)
that
signal the likelihood of stuttering. Our results are
consistent with Garcia-Barrera and Davidow’s (2015)
proposition that
stuttering is
learned based on experiences of stuttering co-occurring
with cues. The relatively even distribution of antici-
pation ratings across words and across the group (with
the exception of higher anticipation on words that
start with plosives), highlights the subjective nature of
anticipation, suggesting that the expectancy to stutter
is most strongly linked to the unique experiences of indi-
viduals who stutter with regard to stuttering in specific
contexts, and less to do with the characteristics of the
words themselves. The present results can be explained
by Garcia-Barrera and Davidow’s model in that there
was a significant correlation between stuttering severity
and both the consistency of word-level anticipation
rating (correlation between visit one and visit two) and
the anticipation of stuttering on specific sounds. It
seems reasonable to speculate that those individuals
who exhibit more severe stuttering have more frequent

Relationship between word-level stuttering
anticipation and VRT
A primary goal of this study was to investigate the
relationship between stuttering anticipation and the
efficiency of perceptually fluent speech production,
as measured by VRT. While only two of the 12 AWS
showed a significant correlation between anticipation
and VRT, it is important to note that these were the
two AWS with the most severe stuttering. The SAMI
framework provides several ways to interpret
the
in press). At one
results of
extreme, it can be concluded that the magnitude of
influence from stuttering anticipation (via the moni-
toring system) was similar across the group of AWS,
but there was also a continuum of speech production
system efficiency across the group. As such, the AWS
with more efficient speech production systems, and
hence less severe stuttering, showed smaller effects
from stuttering anticipation in their perceptually
fluent speech. Using this perspective, speech pro-
duction efficiency might explain why there was no sig-
nificant correlation between stuttering anticipation
and VRT in AWS with less severe stuttering. This is
similar to how a person riding a less stable bicycle
(e.g., flat tires, loose handle bars, etc.) would be more
likely to lose stability in windy conditions than a
person riding a bicycle in good condition in similar
windy conditions. At the other extreme, results could
be interpreted as evidence that the AWS in this study
production
efficient
possessed
systems, but the magnitude of influence from stuttering
anticipation varies across the AWS. Expanding upon
the bicycle analogy, they are riding similar bicycles
but the strength of the wind varied across the group
and resulted in differences in motor performance.

It is reasonable to assume that there was a range of
both speech production system efficiency and magni-
tude of influence from stuttering anticipation across
the participants in this study. This assumption is
based on the range of stuttering severity and the
range of responses regarding anticipation on the
ASQ. Since there was a significant positive correlation
between the belief that anticipation increases stuttering
(ASQ 5) and stuttering severity, and that the two
participants that showed a significant relationship
between anticipation and VRT were the most severe
and had two of the highest ratings on ASQ 5, it is dif-
ficult to determine whether the latter relationship was
due to a vulnerable speech production system or
whether it was due to high levels of stuttering antici-
pation and the belief that anticipation does affect
speech production. Of interest here as well is that the

between actual stuttering and word-level anticipation
ratings during the task also had two of the highest
ratings on ASQ 5, indicating that they agree that stut-
tering anticipation increases the likelihood of stutter-
ing. Based on the SAMI
framework (Arenas,
influences of anticipation on speech pro-
in press),
duction could be through preemptive inhibition when
errors are anticipated to occur (Brown and Braver,
2005). Inhibition could occur through the initiation of
‘Global NoGo’ signals in the subthalamic nucleus
(Aron et al., 2007; Marco-Pallarés et al., 2008;
Tanimura et al., 2011). The error-likelihood hypothesis
of monitoring (Brown and Braver, 2005) states that the
degree of inhibition is related the likelihood of an error
occurring, and may be amplified by beliefs and social/
emotional factors (Cavahagh and Allen, 2008; Hajcak
et al., 2003a, 2003b, 2004). In the context of this
study,
inhibition may be related to the subjective
ratings of word-level stuttering anticipation and ampli-
fied by the belief that anticipation does effect speech
production (ASQ 5). The resulting inhibition then inter-
acts with the efficiency of the speech production system
to determine the motor output. From this framework,
our results suggest that for more severe AWS that
believe that anticipation affects speech production, the
anticipation to stutter may disrupt the speech pro-
duction system to the point that it increases the likeli-
hood of breakdown, in the form of stuttering.

Limitations and future directions
One limitation of this study is the inability of VRT
from a word naming task to specify where within the
process of speech production systems anticipation is
affecting processing, because VRT is a measure of
the end product of several processes converging to
plan and execute the speech motor plan. Future
studies could investigate the effects of stuttering antici-
pation using methods that attempt to parse the speech
production process (Wright et al., 2009), or look at
more global kinematic measures of the stability of
the speech motor output (e.g., Van Lieshout et al.,
2014). Modifying the experiment by incorporating
fMRI could also help to delineate the role of global
motor inhibition that may be initiated by the monitor-
ing system (Brown and Braver, 2005). A second limit-
ation of the study was the use of experimenter selected
word stimuli. It is likely that the words in the 50 word
stimulus set did not include the words that each of the
AWS anticipate stuttering on the most. Future studies
should have the participants create a list of the top
words that they anticipate stuttering on the most,
similar to what was done by Bowers et al. (2012).
This would provide a greater opportunity to see the
relationship between anticipation and fluent speech
because the magnitude of anticipation would likely
be higher than what was observed in this study.

Conclusion
This is the first study to use a within-subject design to
investigate
subjective
measures of stuttering anticipation and perceptually
fluent speech production. Two of 12 AWS showed a
correlation between anticipation and
significant
VRT, and these were the two participants who exhib-
ited the most severe stuttering suggesting that there
may be a relationship between stuttering severity and
the effect of stuttering anticipation on speech pro-
duction. These findings, in combination with a high
degree of predictability of actual stuttering for two of
the more severe AWS, provide preliminary evidence
that stuttering anticipation may influence the speech
production system to the point that it contributes to
the moment of stuttering. From a clinical perspective,
this study provides further evidence that the antici-
pation of stuttering is a salient and pervasive part of
chronic stuttering. A more detailed understanding of
the mechanisms that underlie the influence of antici-
pation on speech production and the complex relation-
ship between stuttering severity and anticipation could
help to inform clinicians with regard to what to focus
on in therapy. For example, if the belief that antici-
pation increases the likelihood of stuttering does in
fact contribute to actual stuttering, it may justify the
use of approaches like cognitive behavioral therapy
(Menzies et al., 2009) or acceptance and commitment
therapy (Beilby et al., 2012) to modify, manage, and
increase awareness of these beliefs.
