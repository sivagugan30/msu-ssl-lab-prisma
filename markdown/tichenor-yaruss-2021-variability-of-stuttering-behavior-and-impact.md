Variability of Stuttering:
Behavior and Impact

Seth E. Tichenora

and J. Scott Yarussa

Purpose: It has long been known that stuttering behaviors
vary across time and situation. Preliminary evidence
suggests that this variability negatively affects people who
stutter and that stuttering behaviors are more variable than
adverse impact associated with stuttering. More information
is needed to determine how variability affects people who
stutter and what the clinical and research implications of
variability may be.
Method: Two hundred and four adults who stutter
participated in a mixed-methods study exploring (a) how
variability of stuttering affects people who stutter in comparison
to other aspects of the condition and (b) which aspects of
the overall experience of stuttering are variable.
Results: Analyses indicated that variability is very commonly
experienced by people who stutter and that it is among the
most frustrating aspects of the condition. Qualitative analyses
revealed that variability is experienced in all aspects of the

stuttering condition, including the observable behavior other
affective, behavioral, and cognitive reactions; and the
adverse impact of stuttering. Notable individual differences
were found in terms of which specific aspects of the
condition were more variable for different respondents.
Overall, analyses revealed that the variability of different
aspects of stuttering can be viewed in a hierarchy from
most variable to least variable: more external aspects
(e.g., frequency, duration), more internal aspects (e.g.,
covert behaviors, physical tension), and cognitive–affective
experiences (e.g., negative thoughts, feelings, and self-
image).
Discussion: These findings suggest that variability is a
common and burdensome aspect of the experience of
stuttering and underscore the importance of considering
variability in stuttering behavior, reactions, and impact in
research, assessment, and treatment for adults who stutter.

I t has long been known that stuttering behaviors vary

across time and situation and that people who stut-
ter exhibit different amounts or degrees of stutter-

ing, depending on factors such as the setting they are in,
whom they are talking to, and what they are talking about
(Constantino et al., 2016; R. J. Ingham, 1975; Shulman,
1955; Yaruss, 1997a). In one early investigation, Shulman
(1955) sought to capture the variability of observed stutter-
ing behaviors by asking participants to read aloud in dif-
ferent speaking situations with different audiences across a
period of 2 weeks. Though participants in the study tended
to stutter less on subsequent readings of the same passage,
their frequency of stuttering increased in some speaking
environments and decreased in others, suggesting a high
degree of variability across situations and over time. Yaruss
(1997a) found that the frequency of both “more typical”

(see Yaruss, 1997a, also called nonstuttered) and “less typi-
cal” (stuttered) disfluencies produced by preschool children
varied greatly across five tasks that are commonly used
in the assessment of stuttering (picture description, story-
telling, play, speaking while under pressure, and conversation
with a parent). Differences in the frequency of stuttering
behaviors between tasks were significantly greater than
the differences in the frequency of stuttering within tasks,
indicating that the speaking task is an important factor
influencing the amount of stuttering behaviors that a child
exhibits. More recently, Constantino et al. (2016) mea-
sured the frequency, duration, and severity of stuttering be-
haviors, as well as adverse impact related to the condition
(see Tichenor & Yaruss, 2019b; Yaruss & Quesal, 2004,
for a discussion of adverse impact) experienced by six adults
who stutter over five separate days spread across 2 weeks.
The frequency of stuttering behavior showed great varia-
tion over time, with some participants changing observ-
able severity classifications (e.g., mild or severe) from
one point in time to another. Adverse impact, as measured

less variable over the 2-week study period.

Variability has been discussed as an aspect of the con-
dition that complicates assessment and treatment (Conture,
1990; Logan & Haj-Tas, 2007; Sawyer & Yairi, 2006;
Starkweather, 1987; Van Riper, 1982), and it is widely
acknowledged that in-clinic speech measures may not be
indicative of speech behaviors in the real world (R. J. Ingham,
1975, 1980). Van Riper (1982) stated,

over time and across situations as a key aspect of their ex-
perience of stuttering. In addition to experiencing variabil-
ity in the stuttering behavior itself, some participants also
reported variability in other aspects of the condition, includ-
ing the presence of physical tension or struggle and the oc-
currence of negative thoughts and feelings. Having so many
aspects of the condition vary has been cited as one of the
factors that makes stuttering so difficult for people to adapt
to. For example, Participant 5 stated:

When estimating severity in the initial diagnosis or
when ascertaining progress at different times during
the course of therapy, it is important not to confine the
speech samples…the amount of stuttering [behavior]
varies markedly in different speaking situations…[and]
may not be representative of [their] real difficulty in
communication. (p. 227)

Some researchers and clinicians have attempted to

account for situational variability of stuttering behavior by
advocating for the use of multiple speech samples, both in
the clinical setting and in other environments (Costello &
Ingham, 1984). Several authors have also advocated for
the use of multiple samples in different environments and
at different points in time in an attempt to capture a more
representative indication of a person’s speech in the real
world (Conture, 2001; Gordon & Luper, 1992; Gregory &
Hill, 1999; J. C. Ingham & Riley, 1998; O’Brian, Packman,
& Onslow, 2004; Yaruss, 1997b). Clinically, the Stuttering
Severity Instrument–Fourth Edition (Riley, 2009) suggests
that clinicians collect a spontaneous speech sample consist-
ing of 150–500 syllables, as well as a reading sample where
appropriate. Speech samples of 100–300 syllables have been
frequently used in research (e.g., Conture, 2001), though
longer samples may provide more representative indications
of a person’s stuttering in a particular situation and at
a particular point in time (see Sawyer & Yairi, 2006, for a
review). Some have advocated for recording longer speech
samples (e.g., 1,200 syllables), with data suggesting that the
frequency of stuttering behaviors increases as speech sample
size increases (Sawyer & Yairi, 2006). These recommenda-
tions attempt to account for the inherent variability in the ob-
servable characteristics of stuttering, both within and between
situations. Still, relatively little research has directly exam-
ined variability itself, and few studies have examined whether
other aspects of the stuttering condition, such as negative
emotional/cognitive reactions to stuttering or the overall
impact of stuttering on a person’s life, vary in a similar way.
Despite the common acknowledgment that stuttering behav-
iors are variable and that this variability impacts assess-
ment or treatment, much less is known about whether or
how much other aspects of the stuttering condition vary
and how any such variability might affect people who stutter.
Preliminary evidence suggests that people who stutter
consider variability to be frustrating and limiting. Tichenor
and Yaruss (2018) explored the experiences of 13 adults
who stutter in order to determine how people who stutter
conceptualize moments of stuttering. The authors found that
people who stutter view variability of stuttering behavior

Actually, I think my stutter has changed a lot
throughout all the years. I’ve picked up habits and
gotten rid of habits, picked up different ones, and
gotten rid of them again…the variability still annoys
me so much. (Tichenor & Yaruss, 2018, p. 1186,
emphasis added)

If variability is contributing to the adverse impact

of stuttering people who stutter experience, then more in-
formation is needed to provide insights about how clini-
cians can help to diminish that adverse impact. A better
understanding of the occurrence and impact of variability
will therefore support improvements in both assessment
(e.g., for more accurately describing the experience of indi-
viduals who stutter) and treatment (e.g., for helping people
cope effectively with the effects of variability). A better
understanding variability will also support improvements
in the categorization and description of participants in
stuttering research. One study has shown that variability
in observable stuttering behavior does not change classifi-
cation status for children who are judged to be stuttering
based on a specific criterion for the production of stutter-
like speech behaviors (Johnson et al., 2009). Still, it is not
yet known whether other aspects of variability might influ-
ence clinical or research classifications or outcomes.

Decades of work have mentioned the value of consid-

ering variability in research, assessment, and treatment
of stuttering (Costello & Ingham, 1984; Gordon & Luper,
1992; J. C. Ingham & Riley, 1998; O’Brian, Packman,
Onslow, & O’Brian, 2004; Sawyer & Yairi, 2006). At pres-
ent, however, it is not actually known how common variabil-
ity is for the population of people who stutter as a whole.
It is also not known whether or how the experience of var-
iability changes over time, and whether or how variability
might cause limitations for people who stutter. Preliminary
evidence, such as that cited above from Tichenor and Yaruss
(2018), suggests that variability is, in and of itself, a frus-
trating aspect of the condition, but it is not known how this
frustration compares to other aspects of the overall stutter-
ing condition. This lack of information about the overall
degree and impact of variability hampers accurate assess-
ment of stuttering, for it is unknown if even long speech
samples in different situations can capture the real-world
variability people who stutter experience on a daily basis.
The general lack of knowledge about variability also ham-
pers appropriate intervention, for clinicians do not yet know
whether or how to address variability within the context of
treatment. More information is needed to determine which
aspects of the stuttering condition are more or less variable.

cians to determine whether findings from scientific or clinical
assessments are applicable to different people’s experiences
of stuttering. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to
explore the variability of stuttering through a mixed-methods
investigation in which adults who stutter were asked about
(a) how variability affects their lives in comparison to other
aspects of the condition and (b) which aspects of their over-
all experience of stuttering are variable.

Method
Participants and Procedure

This study involved an online survey distributed

widely to adults who stutter. The survey, described below,
included a series of Likert and open-ended questions aimed
at exploring how variability affects people’s lives and which
aspects of stuttering are variable. A total of 218 people
opened the link to the survey. Fourteen people were excluded
from final data analysis for completing no meaningful
portions of the survey (i.e., completing nothing past the
consent form). The total number of participants who pro-
vided meaningful data that were analyzed in this study was
204. Demographic data, including age at the time of the
survey, age of stuttering onset, history of participation in
self-help/support and speech therapy, and ethnicity are
presented in Table 1. Demographic data were missing for
some participants because these questions were asked at
the end of the survey, and participants discontinued the
study before completing the final set of questions. Most
participants indicated a history of treatment (74.5%), but
only 40.2% reported a history of self-help/support participa-
tion. Most participants were from the United States, self-
identified as White, and were college graduates.

Recruitment procedures were similar to recent survey

studies published from the Spartan Stuttering Laboratory
at Michigan State University (Tichenor & Yaruss, 2019a,
2019b, 2020a, 2020b). Specifically, participants were re-
cruited using a mix of convenience sampling and snowball
sampling, in which recruitment cascades from one or more
outlets or respondents to others (see Goodman, 1961). Re-
search registries from previous studies, social media outlets,
personal contacts of the authors, word-of-mouth, and national
and international stuttering associations were used to re-
cruit respondents. These various outlets were asked to share
the survey with as many adults who stutter as possible to
encourage a broad sampling of participants from different
backgrounds and with different experiences. Because recruit-
ment was conducted in these varied ways, response rates
cannot be calculated, because it is impossible to determine
how many potential participants were contacted.

The survey was conducted via the Internet using

Qualtrics (Qualtrics, 2020). All respondents were adults of
ages 18 years or older (Mage = 40.96, SD = 16.52), who self-
reported to be people who stutter and who provided in-
formed consent prior to receiving and completing the survey.
The study was deemed to be exempt from institutional

The Survey

The purposes of this study were to explore how the
variability of stuttering affects people’s lives as compared
to other aspects of the condition and to determine which
aspects of stuttering vary. The first purpose involved both
quantitative and qualitative measures, while the second in-
volved quantitative measures only. To begin, a set of items
was developed to broadly describe various aspects of the
stuttering experience that are known from prior research
to adversely affect people who stutter. These included
cognitive/affective reactions, behaviors, and real-world
impact (Craig et al., 2009; Tichenor & Yaruss, 2019b;

Tichenor et al.: Variability of Stuttering: Behavior and Impact 77

Downloaded from: https://pubs.asha.org Michigan State University on 11/11/2025, Terms of Use: https://pubs.asha.org/pubs/rights_and_permissions Yaruss & Quesal, 2004). The authors drew upon their
prior experience with survey and questionnaire develop-
ment (e.g., Tichenor & Yaruss, 2019a; Yaruss & Quesal,
2006) to guide a series of pilot studies in which various
questions addressing different aspects of the experience of
stuttering were reviewed by small focus groups of people
who stutter. The list of items was refined in an iterative
fashion based on feedback from these focus groups before
the broader data collection effort was undertaken. In total,
the piloting process involved feedback from approximately
25 people who stutter.

Based on this larger list of items, three specific ques-
tions related to variability were purposefully added by the
authors to examine how frustration related to variability
compares to frustration related to other aspects of stutter-
ing. The first item intentionally did not operationalize vari-
ability (how variable is stuttering?), and two other items
intentionally did operationalize variability in terms of vari-
ability across time (I stutter more at some times and less
at others) and variability across situation (I stutter more
in some situations and less in other situations). The responses
for these questions were the same as the other frustration-
related questions in Figure 1 (i.e., not frustrating to a large
amount of frustrating). Participants were asked to rate how
frustrating they found each of these aspects before pro-
ceeding to specific questions about variability. This was
done to determine how frustration or concern about vari-
ability itself compares to frustration or concern about other
well-documented aspects of the stuttering condition. The
full list of items can be found in Figure 1.

Next, participants answered a single question, with
a binary yes–no outcome, about whether they experienced
variability of stuttering (do you experience variability re-
lated to stuttering?). Participants who indicated that they
did experience variability related to stuttering then com-
pleted a set of multicomponent open-ended questions to
ascertain their experiences related to variability. Examples
of these questions included: “Please describe your experi-
ence of variability in relation to stuttering”; “What does
variability mean to you?”; and “What aspects of stuttering
are variable and which are not?”

Lastly, all participants who indicated that they expe-
rience variability (as measured via the binary question de-
scribed above) were asked follow-up questions to determine
the degree of variability for each of the various aspects of
their experience of stuttering. These items were reviewed
and refined via a similar pilot process as described above.
The overall goal was to create items that would capture
an accurate representation of the experiences of people who
stutter with respect to variability across a range of different
aspects of the stuttering condition (Tichenor & Yaruss,
2019b; Yaruss & Quesal, 2004). These items can be found
in Figure 2 and Table 2.

Data Analysis

Data recorded in Qualtrics were exported to and ana-
lyzed in RStudio (RStudio, 2020), a companion program to

R (R Core Team, 2020). Various R packages were used
for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization (Huang,
2016; Ludecke, 2020; Revelle, 2019; Wickham, 2016).
All data were manually checked for data entry or coding
errors. Because items were created to capture multidi-
mensional constructs of the stuttering condition (e.g.,
overt features, thoughts, feelings), exploratory factor
analysis was completed to determine the underlying
structure of the constructs. Confirmatory factor analy-
sis was not conducted in order to reduce the likelihood
that new structures would be overlooked. The factors
were assumed to correlate with one another because
prior research has shown that various aspects of the
stuttering condition are conceptually related to one an-
other (Smith & Weber, 2017; Tichenor & Yaruss, 2019b;
Yaruss & Quesal, 2006). The correlations among the
three factors (described below in the results section)
ranged from −.23 to .24. Though none of the correla-
tions exceeded the .32 cutoff recommended by Tabachnick
and Fidell (2019) for oblique rotations, the factor correla-
tions were far enough from zero that an oblique (promax)
rotation was used in the factor analysis (Russell, 2002).
The promax rotation was selected because it “first con-
ducts an orthogonal varimax rotation and then allows
correlations between the factors in an attempt to improve
the fit to simple structure” (Russell, 2002, p. 1638). In
order to estimate the number of factors, eigenvalues were
estimated and plotted via scree plot. The estimated eigen-
values were plotted via parallel analysis. Lower and higher
factor loadings were explored for interpretability with scree
plots as a guide.

The analysis of the participants’ responses to the
open-ended questions was conducted via the process of
phenomenology, a method of qualitative analysis that allows
researchers to describe the shared meaning of a lived expe-
rience of a phenomenon (Creswell, 2013). Several recent
studies used phenomenology to explore various aspects of
stuttering, such as anticipation (Jackson et al., 2015), what
comprises an effective therapeutic alliance (Plexico et al.,
2010), and how moments of stuttering are experienced
(Tichenor & Yaruss, 2018). Because variability related to
stuttering is a shared experience of people who stutter (i.e.,
one that many people who stutter experience), a phenome-
nological approach was selected for analyzing the shared
experience of variability in this study.

Common principles of phenomenology and qualita-
tive analyses were used for data analysis (Boyatzis, 1998;
Charmaz, 2004; Creswell, 2013; Myers & Newman, 2007).
Specifically, the first author (a person who stutters) began
by preparing a narrative description of his own experiences
related to the variability of stuttering in order to acknowl-
edge and set aside his own views. This record was reviewed
during the analysis to ensure that data were not being in-
advertently analyzed in a way that too narrowly matched
the investigators’ own views related to variability. This is
viewed as an important step in qualitative research, because
it helps to reduce unintentional bias and the tendency for
researchers to interpret participant responses in terms of

their own experiences and views (see Creswell, 2013, for
a discussion). To accomplish this, textual data from the
open-ended question described above were then downloaded
as plain text files and imported into RQDA (Huang, 2016),
a qualitative analysis package developed for the R statistical
computing package (R Core Team, 2020). The first author
then read each statement for a broad understanding of the
participants’ responses. Through subsequent readings and
rereadings, significant statements were coded according to
words or phrases that captured their meanings. These

significant statements were grouped and regrouped as
needed, in an iterative fashion, as meaning and structure
in the qualitative data were more clearly seen (Braun &
Clarke, 2006). These groupings were eventually formed into
the themes discussed below. A culminating essential struc-
ture of the phenomenon was then created from the themes
and quotes to illustrate a composite description of the phe-
nomenon. This essential structure reflects, “the essence of
the experience and represents the culminating aspect of
the phenomenological study” (Creswell, 2013, p. 194).

external aspects were experienced as the most variable while more internal and cognitive/affective aspects were experienced as less
variable.

Credibility

The themes reported below come from all qualitative

data collected. Consistent with past qualitative stuttering
research using large samples of data (e.g., Tichenor & Yaruss,
2019b) and qualitative standard practice (Fusch & Ness,
2015), no saturation analysis was conducted on the quali-
tative data. The consistency of themes, the large sample

size, and the varied backgrounds of participants support
the credibility of the results. Consistent with established
reliability procedures in qualitative research (Syed & Nelson,
2015), the second author then completed a reliability analy-
sis on the themes by coding 20% of the data independent
of the first author. The structure and content of the themes
coded by the second author matched those identified by

Results

This study was a mixed-methods investigation seek-
ing to explore how variability affects people who stutter
in comparison to other aspects of stuttering and to learn
more about which aspects of stuttering are experienced as
variable. The first purpose involved both quantitative and
qualitative methods, while the second was purely quantita-
tive. Results for each analysis are presented separately.

Quantitative Data

How Does Variability Affect People Who Stutter?

Figure 1 presents the degree of frustration experienced

by participants across different aspects of the condition.
Analyses revealed that the most frustrating aspect of stut-
tering for these respondents was the fact that they experi-
ence a sensation of feeling stuck when speaking that is,
that they stutter (see Tichenor & Yaruss, 2019b, for discus-
sion of how common this sensation is). In this study, 81.7%
of participants indicated that they experience a large or
medium amount of frustration due to the fact that they
stutter. Of the remaining 20 items representing different
aspects of the experience of stuttering, items related to
variability were rated as the next most frustrating. Specifi-
cally, 72.8% of participants indicated that they experience
a large or medium amount of frustration because they
stutter more at some times and less at other times (Q16),
and 72.6% of participants indicated that they experience a
large or medium amount of frustration because they stut-
ter more in some situations than in other situations (Q19).
Fully 68.2% of participants reported that they experience

a large or medium amount of frustration directly related
to the variability of stuttering (Q6). These data indicate
that variability is among the most frustrating aspects of stut-
tering experienced by adults who stutter.

were related to limitations stuttering may cause in daily
life. Specifically, only 43.7% of participants reported that
they experience a large or medium amount of frustration
related to “how much stuttering limits me in daily life.”
Also, 36.1% of participants reported that they experience
a large or medium amount of frustration with choosing
to text rather than make a phone call.

How Common Is the Experience of Variability?

Participants were asked, “Do you experience variability

with stuttering?” Of the 202 participants who answered that
question, 196 (97%) indicated that they do experience vari-
ability. Thus, variability of stuttering was reported to be
pervasive among this large sample of adults who stutter.

Which Aspect(s) of Stuttering Are Variable?

A three-factor structure was identified for the vari-

ability items. For ease of interpretation, these three factors
are referred to as more external (e.g., frequency and dura-
tion), more internal (e.g., physical tension and covert behav-
iors), and cognitive–affective (e.g., negative thoughts and
feelings about oneself ). The structure of the items revealed
some items with low factor loadings. Items of factor load-
ings of less than 0.3 were considered not to significantly
measure the construct (Hair et al., 1998) and were removed
from the factors (Field, 2003). Items were also investigated
to prevent cross-loading on factors. Items that did not load
significantly higher on one factor were excluded from both
factors (Matsunaga, 2010). Cronbach’s alpha was then
calculated on each factor to establish internal consistency

Downloaded from: https://pubs.asha.org Michigan State University on 11/11/2025, Terms of Use: https://pubs.asha.org/pubs/rights_and_permissions (Cronbach, 1951). Table 2 shows the factor loadings, factors,
and internal consistency coefficients. The internal consis-
tency coefficients were acceptable for the first and third
factors (Cortina, 1993). The average interitem correlation
between items comprising factor 2 was .27, indicating an
acceptable mean interitem correlation (Briggs & Cheek,
1986, define acceptable factor loadings as having mean
interitem correlations between .2 and .4). Responses to the
items that loaded on the three factors are graphically repre-
sented in Figure 2.

The most variable aspects were frequency and severity
of stuttering: 74.9% of respondents indicated that frequency
was often or always variable, and 72.3% of respondents
indicated that severity was often or always variable. The
least variable aspects were how stuttering makes me think
about myself and the negative thoughts and feelings regard-
ing stuttering. These least variable aspects were reported to
be not at all variable or only slightly variable by 65.4% and
62.7% of participants, respectively. The distributions in
responses visualized in Figure 2 parallel the more exter-
nal, more internal, and cognitive–affective factors listed in
Table 2, so items are grouped via those factors for ease
of interpretation. Overall, the most variable experiences
were the more external ones, including frequency, duration,
severity, and perceived speaking effort. The more internal
items, including physical tension and covert behaviors, were
in the middle of the continuum; slightly variable and often
variable were the most reported Likert responses for these
items. The two cognitive–affective items, that is, how stutter-
ing makes me think about myself and the negative thoughts
and feelings regarding stuttering, were least variable. Over-
all, the data support past literature suggesting that adults
who stutter commonly experience variability and that the
more external features of stuttering are more variable than
the more internal features (see Constantino et al., 2016).

Qualitative Analyses

Analysis of the participants’ responses to the open-

ended questions in the survey revealed 418 significant state-
ments across the responses of the 204 participants. These
significant statements were combined into meaning units
by similarity, culminating in an initial set of 29 broad cate-
gories describing participants’ experience of variability. These
initial categories were further reviewed and combined in
an iterative fashion, based on commonality, to form themes.
A list of themes is shown in Table 3, and detailed descrip-
tions of themes are provided below. The quotes presented
in the text represent examples of the statements that describe

the themes for this large sample of people who stutter.
Some of the quotes presented here represent more than
one theme. This corresponds to the multifaceted ways
in which participants described variability in relation to
stuttering. Not every instance of a theme is included here
for brevity; rather, the quotes are used to “bring in the
voice of the participants” and to provide examples of the
themes (Creswell, 2013, p. 219). Note that participant
numbers were assigned before some participants were ex-
cluded from analysis.

All Aspects of Stuttering Vary

Participants described how all aspects of stuttering
are variable across both time and place. While no single
participant indicated that they experienced variability in
every aspect of stuttering, participants as a group indicated
that they experience variability in the frequency, duration,
types of behaviors, their reactions to stuttering, and the im-
pact of stuttering on their lives.

P(3): Who doesn’t experience variability in stuttering?
To me, variability IS stuttering. Everything about
stuttering varies.
P(77): …Aspects of stuttering that are variable to
me are fear of stuttering, amount, and duration of
stuttering.
P(59): …At times I can speak fluently without any
trouble, then at other times there is a particular sound
or word that I can’t force out of my mouth or I
struggle to begin speaking at all.
P(39): My stuttering is variable in its severity….
P(83): Variability also means that there are times
when I struggle on certain words…for long periods
of time and suddenly I am fine with those words
but struggle with different words that I previously
had no difficulty with.
P(141): I view variability in stuttering as the differences
in tension, how big my blocks are, and the types
of stutters I experience. There will be days when
my blocks are very small and I can easily get out
of them, and other days when I seem to struggle
on every word. I will stutter every day, so that is
not a variable part of stuttering but the intensity
and type of stutters are.

Variability Across Time

Variability across time was discussed as a central

component to variability. Importantly, participants described
both short-term fluctuations (e.g., minutes, hours, and days)
and longer-term fluctuations (e.g., weeks, months, seasons,
years).

P(16): Variable in terms of time of day, actual day,
week, or month. Frequency of disfluency is variable;
could be fluent for days then a return to disfluency
for weeks/months….
P(22): …Fluency in general, is highly variable in my
experience. I can speak fluently for 2 weeks, and

my child’s name….
P(30): Variability is when stuttering goes through
spells of good and bad times. I can often find myself
snowballing into a pattern of time when I stutter
more, then have good spells when I do not stutter
for days or weeks!
P(120): …Some days/week/months/years I’ll hardly
stutter, and sometimes I stutter a couple times in
every sentence.
P(145): …When I was young, the period when I
spoke fluently [or] when I couldn’t speak a single
word was very short (like a week with stuttering
and two or three days without stuttering). But, when
I grew up, this period was very long (like 3 or
4 months with stuttering and a one or two months
without stuttering).

Variability Across Situations

Variability across situations or places was also dis-
cussed as a central component to variability. The situations
and locations discussed were individualized; no single situ-
ation or location was discussed as more variable by all
participants. In fact, the same location was sometimes men-
tioned as being more stable by one person but more variable
by another (e.g., speaking on a telephone).

P(20): …I stutter more frequently in some circumstances
and less frequently at others. It depends on the
situation…who I’m speaking to, how much pressure
there is (e.g., competing to talk, talking over each
other, etc.) or how polite the listener/audience is.
P(32): I never stutter when talking to myself, stutter
a little bit when talking to my friends, and stutter
a lot when in school or around a bunch of people.
P(33): The variability of stuttering in contexts also
happens to me—sometimes when I speak to a room
full of strangers, the ones that I work with vs. the
ones that I don’t changes my speaking experience
(more stuttering with people that I am associated
with in some way even if I don’t know them).
P(45): Stuttering is very situational for me and
depends on context, conversational partners…. If
I can practice a presentation or speech I have to
give I will stutter significantly less than if I have
to speak in front of people off the cuff. The severity
of stuttering is dependent on the context of the speech-
moment.
P(154): [Stuttering] becomes less when you are more
friendly with someone…especially on the telephone….
Sometimes I stutter only a few times in a whole
conversation but on other occasions I try to prolong
the sentences and substitute words to avoid stuttering.
P(53): I experience severe stuttering when I talk in
public. I stutter a bit if I talk to my family. [I have
a] mild stutter when I talk to people outside, i.e.,
in public transportation. I also stutter a lot if I talk
on the telephone, to a teller, or to customer support
making for an inquiry or something.

Individuality

In addition to the variability across time and variabil-
ity across situation themes, participants also discussed their
idiosyncratic relationship with various aspects of speaking
and communicating that make their experience of stuttering
more or less variable. The term individuality was chosen as
a way of describing these specific relationships to stuttering
and its variability. For example, participants reported that
certain words, phrases, sounds, or syllables are experienced
as more or less variable in a way that is meaningful to them,
both personally and individually. This person-centered
meaning was described as a central experience of variability
related to stuttering.

P(36): Sometimes I only stutter on “s” words, but
other times it seems like it could be anything….
There are certain “s” consonants that I will always
stutter on, so that is not variable…. But other times,
I can say some “s” words fine and speak mostly
fluently….
P(67): To me, variability means how my fluency and
problem letters change over time…. For me, the
letter sets seem to cycle monthly…for example, some
problems letters similar to “th” will be hard for a
month only to go away and have the “b” letter family
have issues.
P(72): Some words are always troubling, while others
it’s occasional.
P(114): I experience variability in the flow of speech
during conversation. Sometimes my explanations get
stuck on words that I did not have trouble with at
other times…. There is sometimes variability in the
location of where I stutter in a word. Mostly it’s on
the first sound or syllable of words, but sometimes,
unexpectedly, it will be in the middle of a words.
P(190): Over the course of time certain sounds or
parts of words are more likely to be a disfluency point
than others, but that also changes…I have had years
where a “s” sound would be more generally more
disfluent that others, but that changes. I have also
had stretches of time where “f” sounds have a higher
rate of disfluency. But this changes and has no
discernable beginning or end….

The Effects of Adverse Impact on Variability

Adverse impact (e.g., the negative thoughts, feelings,
behaviors, and associated real-world limitations) was re-
ported to be a cause of increased amounts of variability
related to stuttering. Variability was described as increasing
or decreasing as a function of how much adverse impact
the speakers experience on a moment-by-moment basis.

P(127): When I am tired, stressed, or pressured to
talk, my stuttering is much worse.
P(129): …in more relaxed situations, stuttering is less
frequent; in situations where I am excited, stressed,
or tired, stuttering is more frequent.
P(142): From what I can gather, the variability has a
lot to do with how I am managing my internal state

Tichenor et al.: Variability of Stuttering: Behavior and Impact 83

Downloaded from: https://pubs.asha.org Michigan State University on 11/11/2025, Terms of Use: https://pubs.asha.org/pubs/rights_and_permissions of being…when I’m feeling highly self-conscious I
tend to be less focused on being present and more
impacted by outside stimuli…[I] end up devoting
my resources to maintain a sense of calm, which to
a degree impacts my ability to just communicate
freely. I find that when I’m thinking about my speech
I tend to be more susceptible to a higher frequency
and duration of moments of stuttering…. The more
openness that I have, the less focused I am on
anticipating and trying to prevent stuttering and I
just slip into modification tools with ease if a moment
of stuttering surfaces.

The Essential Structure of Variability

Based on the results presented above, an essential

structure of the experience of variability from the perspec-
tives of participants was developed:

Behaviors, thoughts, and feelings related to stuttering
and their associated real-world limitations are
experienced by adults who stutter to vary across
time and situation. As a group, adults who stutter
experience variability in all aspects of the stuttering
condition. Individuality distinguishes adults who
stutter from one another in terms of which aspects
are experienced as more or less variable. Greater
levels of adverse impact of these features can cause
increased amounts of variability to be experienced in
other areas. This compounding nature of variability
and adverse impact is a central component of the
stuttering condition.

This essential structure, which was derived from

analysis of the qualitative data, can be combined with the
results of the quantitative analysis, which showed that some
aspects of stuttering vary more while other aspects of stut-
tering vary less. Together, these findings provide a compre-
hensive picture of (a) how people who stutter experience
variability and (b) the ways that this variability affects them
in their daily lives.

Discussion

This study explored variability related to stuttering
in order to determine how variability affects people who
stutter in comparison to other aspects of stuttering and to
determine which aspects of stuttering are experienced as
variable. The vast majority of adults who stutter in this study
(97%) reported that they experience variability related to
stuttering. Moreover, variability was the second most frus-
trating aspect of the condition for these respondents. The
only aspect of stuttering that was rated as more frustrating
was the fact that people who stutter feel stuck in their
speech (i.e., that they stutter). These findings highlight the
clinical and theoretical importance of variability in relation
to stuttering. Though many clinicians and researchers have
long highlighted variability as a hindrance to accurate
measurement of stuttering (Conture, 1990; Costello &
Ingham, 1984; Gordon & Luper, 1992; J. C. Ingham &

Riley, 1998; O’Brian, Packman, & Onslow, 2004; Sawyer
& Yairi, 2006; Starkweather, 1987; Van Riper, 1982; Yaruss,
1997a), the present findings highlight that variability itself
is pervasive and that it negatively impacts the lives of adults
who stutter. This underscores the importance of consider-
ing variability in evaluation, assessment, and treatment
and suggests that variability may have been overlooked
and underconsidered in prior treatment and research
endeavors.

Data from this study also expand upon past research,

suggesting that participants in this study reported that
more external features of stuttering (e.g., frequency and
duration of speech disfluencies) are more variable than
more internal features (e.g., physical tension and covert
behaviors). More internalized and covert behaviors (e.g.,
the amount of physical tension experienced with stutter-
ing or when not stuttering, and avoiding sounds, words, or
situations) were reported as more variable than cognitive–
affective experiences (e.g., sense of self and negative
thoughts). These findings indicate that internalized reactions
or covert behaviors (Constantino et al., 2017; Douglass &
Quarrington, 1952; Murphy et al., 2007; Tichenor et al.,
2017; Tichenor & Yaruss, 2019a) should be assessed and
addressed at various time points and in different situations,
just as overt behaviors should be (Costello & Ingham,
1984). By not assessing covert features in this manner,
a clinician may misunderstand a person’s underlying expe-
rience of stuttering, underestimate the impact of stuttering
on the speaker’s life, and potentially, though unintention-
ally, limit progress in therapy.

The qualitative data from this study further support
the idea that variability should be a central consideration
in diagnosing and treating the stuttering condition. The
ways in which participants highlighted their individual
experiences of variability are reminiscent of the ways in
which people who stutter, more broadly, experience stut-
tering. Tichenor and Yaruss (2019b) described the pheno-
type of a person’s individual experience of the stuttering
condition and differentiated that phenotype from the many
other ways that other people who stutter may experience
their own stuttering. Thus, people who stutter experience
individuality in their affective, behavioral, and cognitive
personal reactions, as well as in the ways that those reac-
tions result in real-world impact. Similarly, although there
were commonalities across this large group of participants,
individual participants in this study reported that they ex-
perience variability in their own unique ways. The aspects
of stuttering that vary differed from person to person,
indicating that clinicians should not overgeneralize their
assumptions about the experience of stuttering or its vari-
ability. Still, quantitative data in this study suggest that
some aspects of the stuttering condition are experienced to
be more variable (more external features) and less vari-
able (cognitive–affective aspects) across this large sample
of adults who stutter. Variability itself may occur as the
summative effect of underlying etiology, primary impair-
ments, personal factors, limitations, and external factors
(Tichenor & Yaruss, 2019b; Yaruss & Quesal, 2004) and

84 American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology (cid:129) Vol. 30 (cid:129) 75–88 (cid:129) January 2021

Downloaded from: https://pubs.asha.org Michigan State University on 11/11/2025, Terms of Use: https://pubs.asha.org/pubs/rights_and_permissions its manifestation in the life of an individual person who
stutters is person-specific. Thus, clinicians should assess
the experience of variability related to stuttering individ-
ually within each subject to guide treatment.

Not incorporating variability as one guide to treat-
ment may increase the adverse impact that a person who
stutters experiences. Specific quotes from participants high-
light such a possibility. For example, P(142) stated:

Variability has a lot to do with how I am managing
my internalized state of being…when I’m feeling
highly self-conscious, I tend to be less focused on
being present and more impacted by outside stimuli…
[I] end up devoting my resources to maintain a sense
of calm, which to a degree impacts my ability to just
communicate freely. I find that when I’m thinking
about my speech, I tend to be more susceptible to
a higher frequency and duration of moments of
stuttering.

Comments such as these highlight the clinical impli-

cations of the current findings, in that variability itself is
contributing to the adverse impact people who stutter ex-
perience. Specifically, recent research has highlighted the
impact of undiffused thoughts and emotions. Tichenor and
Yaruss (2020b) found that adults who stutter who engage
in high degrees of repetitive negative thinking (RNT) are
more likely to have greater levels of adverse impact related
to stuttering than adults who stutter who engage in RNT
less frequently. Consistent with this finding, Constantino
et al. (2020) found that individuals who are more sponta-
neous with communication experience significantly less ad-
verse impact related to stuttering. Current findings suggest
that therapies that encourage increased spontaneity and
decreased RNT may help to decrease variability, perhaps
by helping people learn to cope with variability and thereby
minimize the impact of variability on people’s lives. For-
tunately, many current approaches to stuttering treatment
seek to help speakers understand their thoughts associated
with stuttering and to defuse their emotional reactions
from those thoughts (Beilby et al., 2013, 2012; Blood,
1995; Boyle, 2011; Cheasman, 2013; Emerick, 1988; Gupta
et al., 2016; Harley, 2018; Helgadóttir et al., 2014; Kelman
& Wheeler, 2015; Kuster et al., 2013; Menzies et al., 2008,
2009; Plexico & Sandage, 2011; Van Riper, 1973). Impor-
tantly, such therapeutic approaches have been shown to
decrease some of the adverse impact related to stuttering
(Menzies et al., 2008). A clinician who uses such holistic
treatment approaches may thereby increase a person’s resil-
ience and decrease the likelihood that they will be negatively
impacted by variability.

Future Directions and Limitations

This study explored the experiences of variability
related to stuttering in adults who stutter. Although the
large sample size and detailed qualitative analyses convey
confidence in the findings, there are still limitations that
must be considered when these results are applied to future

research and clinical endeavors. For example, preliminary
research has shown that people who stutter who live in
different countries or cultures may experience the adverse
impact related to stuttering differently, a finding that may
be associated with research indicating that there are differ-
ences in public perceptions of stuttering across cultures (see
St. Louis et al., 2016, for a review). Such differences in per-
sonal and public perceptions may influence how people ex-
perience stuttering in general. Given that variability places a
significant burden on people who stutter, it may be fruitful
to study whether this burden might be affected by societal
perceptions in addition to self-perceptions. Furthermore, the
third factor of cognitive–affective aspects of stuttering was
composed of only two items. This is the absolute mini-
mum for exploratory factor analyses (Worthington &
Whittaker, 2006). Although the reliability of this factor
was acceptable (α = .76), future research should replicate
this finding with more items to increase confidence in the
factor and in the findings more broadly.

Future qualitative work in this area should also ex-

plore the experiences of variability as they develop over time.
Given that the data from this study come from adults, care
should be taken when applying these findings to children.
It is possible that children and adolescents who stutter may
experience differing degrees of variability or that different
aspects of their experience of stuttering might vary in dif-
ferent ways. Exploring these possibilities may add valu-
able understanding to the development of variability and
its impact over time.

Quantitative data from this study suggest that more
internal aspects of stuttering (e.g., frequency, struggle, du-
ration) are experienced as variable, though not to the same
degree as more external features (e.g., tension, avoidance,
reactions of others). Past researchers have suggested using
speech samples over multiple time points or in multiple
environments as a way to capture a measure of the person’s
true stuttering that is indicative of the person’s speech in
the real world (Costello & Ingham, 1984; Gordon & Luper,
1992; J. C. Ingham & Riley, 1998; O’Brian, Packman, &
Onslow, 2004; Sawyer & Yairi, 2006; Yaruss, 1997a). A
critical and open question remains of how much or how
many speech samples are enough to capture a person’s
experience of stuttering—or even whether there is such a
construct as a single, “true” stuttering if the experience is
inherently variable. Future research should more directly
address this with in situ with day-long, week-long, or month-
long speech samples collected in numerous real-world situa-
tions and with different conversation partners as a person
lives their life. Relatedly, future work should expand the
items in this study to other aspects of the overall experience
of stuttering (e.g., acceptance or communicative effective-
ness) to ascertain whether these aspects of the stuttering
condition are also experienced as being variable.

Summary

This study demonstrates that variability related to
stuttering is one of the most frustrating aspects of living

stuttering is common for people who stutter. The qualita-
tive data further highlight the importance and nature of
variability as it relates to both clinical work and research
with people who stutter. Accounting for variability in a
way that is consistent with the experiences of people who
stutter may therefore lead to more accurate assessment,
more effective treatments, and greater generalizability of
research findings.
