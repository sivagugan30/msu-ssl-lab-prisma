Fear of Negative Evaluation, Trait Anxiety,
and Judgment Bias in Adults who Stutter

Shelley B. Brundage,a Katherine L. Winters,a and Janet M. Beilbyb

Purpose: Persons who stutter (PWS) and those with social
anxiety disorder may exhibit fear of negative evaluation (FNE)
and anxiety in social situations. However, the information
processing biases that perpetuate these characteristics have
had limited investigation. This study investigated judgment
bias in social situations.
Method: Participants included 50 adults who stutter and
45 age- and gender-matched fluent persons who do not
stutter (PWNS), who made up the control group. Participants
completed the Interpretation and Judgmental Questionnaire
(Voncken, Bögels, & deVries, 2003), and threat scores were
calculated.
Results: There were no significant differences between
PWS and PWNS in social threat or nonsocial threat

scores. When the PWS group was divided on the basis
of FNE and compared with PWNS participants without
heightened anxiety (n = 35), the PWS with high FNE had
significantly higher total social threat scores than the
PWS with low FNE. The three groups did not differ in
threat ratings for ambiguous or profoundly negative
social situations.
Conclusions: Judgment bias in PWS is mediated by the
magnitude of FNE present; not all PWS exhibit judgment
bias for social situations. Treatment implications include
the need for psychosocial support addressing the
negative impacts on quality of life and restrictions on
social engagement that stuttering may cause in some
individuals.

A recent meta-analysis of research in stuttering

disorders suggested a correlation between social
anxiety disorder (SAD) and stuttering, in that

the two disorders can occur concurrently (Craig & Tran,
2014). It has been argued that the two populations share
symptomatology, including fear of negative evaluation
(FNE); content-specific fear or anxiety toward social situa-
tions; and the use of avoidance or safety behaviors, such as
avoiding eye contact (Iverach & Rapee, 2013; Lowe et al.,
2012; Mahr & Torosian, 1999; Messenger, Onslow, Packman,
& Menzies, 2004). These findings, however, have been chal-
lenged due to concerns about diagnosis and sampling pro-
cedures, as well as the additional burden on the individuals
of potential labels and associated stigma (Manning & Beck,
2011). Although the two disorders appear to share some
presenting symptoms, the underlying mechanisms responsible
for SAD have only recently begun to be systematically inves-
tigated in persons who stutter (PWS). This article explores
symptoms and underlying mechanisms of SAD, specifically

judgment bias, in a sample of PWS and in age- and gender-
matched persons who do not stutter (PWNS).

The American Psychiatric Association (2013) pub-

lishes the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis-
orders, now in its fifth edition (DSM-5), in which various
disorders are defined and assessment and treatment proce-
dures are described. In the DSM-5, SAD is characterized
by intense fear of social or performance-based situations
where evaluation by others may occur. Additional diagnostic
criteria include the following: (a) anxiety and avoidance of
social situations that interfere with one’s social or occupa-
tional routine; (b) fear, anxiety, and avoidance for a duration
of at least 6 months; and (c) a recognition that one’s fear
associated with social situations is extreme. In confirming the
diagnosis of SAD, the person must exhibit fear or anxiety in
social situations that is deemed to be “out of proportion to the
actual threat posed by the social situation” (DSM-5, p. 203;
Heimberg, et al., 2014). In earlier versions of the diagnostic
definition of SAD, the presence of stuttering was an exclu-
sionary criterion for social anxiety in the DSM, fourth
edition, Text Revision (American Psychiatric Association,
2000; Iverach, Menzies, O’Brian, Packman, & Onslow,
2011), meaning that a person could not be diagnosed with
SAD if they also stuttered. The American Psychiatric Asso-
ciation (2013) recently revised its definition of social anxiety
in the DSM-5 to include fear or anxiety in response to a

normally be felt” for an individual presenting with an addi-
tional diagnosis such as stuttering (DSM-5, p. 203). This
change in definition allows PWS to be diagnosed with SAD
if indeed they demonstrate reactions that are out of propor-
tion to given social situations.

Somewhat surprisingly, the DSM-5 does not specify

the comparison group for determining whether a reaction
is out of proportion to the actual threat involved. Instead,
the DSM-5 states that the clinician should make the deci-
sion about whether a given response is “out of proportion
to the actual threat” because “individuals with social anx-
iety disorder often overestimate the negative consequences
of social situations” (DSM-5, p. 204) and therefore may
not be in a position to accurately judge their own responses.
However, making the clinical decision regarding out-of-
proportion responses is challenging, due to the lack of norms
regarding what constitutes an out-of-proportion response
to a given situation. Until normative data become available
for determining what constitutes out-of-proportion responses
in the general population, it seems reasonable to use the
clients’ own responses to nonsocial situations as baselines
for comparison, rather than relying on clinicians to make
these decisions.

Stuttering is a speech disorder that may lead to affec-

tive, cognitive, and behavioral reactions. Disruptions in
the forward flow of speech often lead to affective reactions
such as anxiety, behavioral avoidance of social situations,
and negative thoughts about oneself as a speaker (Manning,
2010). PWS can experience difficulty with social commu-
nication and are at risk for disabilities or handicaps as a
result of their speech difficulties. For example, PWS can
experience negative cognitive reactions or feelings associ-
ated with their stuttering that limit and ultimately handicap
their ability to participate in social situations (Yaruss, 2007).
Although this parallels the content-specific fear associated
with SAD (DSM-5), these negative thoughts or feelings may
not be “out of proportion to what would normally be felt”
in all PWS.

Current Relationship Between Stuttering
and Social Anxiety

FNE and social anxiety are considered major com-
ponents in the maintenance of stuttering and also in indi-
viduals with SAD (Amir & Bomyea, 2010; Craig & Tran,
2014; Iverach & Rapee, 2013; Iverach, O’Brian et al., 2009;
Mahr & Torosian, 1999; Messenger et al., 2004). Symptoms
associated with SAD include FNE; expectancies of social
harm; negative cognitions; attention biases; and the use of
avoidance and safety behaviors, such as avoiding eye con-
tact (Clark & Wells, 1995; Iverach & Rapee, 2013; Rapee
& Heimberg, 1997; Rapee & Spence, 2004; Rodebaugh
et al., 2004). These characteristics have also been reported
in PWS using self-report scales (Blumgart, Tran, & Craig,
2010; Iverach, O’Brian et al., 2009; Iverach & Rapee, 2013;
Messenger et al., 2004). In addition, PWS have reported
increased trait anxiety and content-specific anxiety toward

social situations (Craig, 1990; Ezrati-Vinacour & Levin,
2004; Iverach & Rapee, 2013; Iverach, O’Brian et al.,
2009). A recent hallmark meta-analysis found evidence
of elevated trait and social anxiety in PWS (Craig & Tran,
2014).

Although these studies suggested that a relationship

exists between stuttering and SAD, they do not provide
evidence that anxiety is a cause of stuttering. In fact, recent
research suggests that stuttering appears first, and social
anxiety may develop in response to the stuttering (Alm, 2014;
Iverach, Jones et al., 2009; Iverach, Jones et al., 2011). Fur-
thermore, the magnitude of the relationship between stutter-
ing and SAD remains equivocal. Some studies report
FNE in PWS as significantly greater than fluent controls
(Messenger et al., 2004), but others indicate that FNE and
trait anxiety in PWS are significantly lower than those exhib-
ited in persons with SAD (Mahr & Torosian, 1999). Some
previous research pertaining to reported heightened social
anxiety in PWS can be challenged on the basis of criteria for
subject selection. The methodologies have included the exclu-
sive recruitment of adult PWS, who have actively sought
treatment and are therefore not typical of the population
as a whole, as well as control groups that are unmatched or
include individuals with personality disorders (Iverach, Jones
et al., 2009; Mahr & Torosian, 1999). Manning and Beck
(2011) further highlighted these methodological drawbacks
by emphasizing the negative impact and stigmatization of
this research on PWS. Additional research studies suggest
that the co-occurrence of SAD and stuttering is infrequent
and caution against the impact of inaccurately labeling PWS
with anxiety disorders (Craig, Hancock, Tran, & Craig, 2003;
Hinshaw & Stier, 2008; Manning & Beck 2011).

As mentioned earlier in this review, persons with

SAD exhibit a fearful or anxious response to social situa-
tions that is “out of proportion” to the potential threat in
those situations (DSM-5). The same is required for PWS
if a SAD diagnosis is in fact to be made: The fear or anxi-
ety in response to social situations must be either “unrelated”
to stuttering or “out of proportion to what would normally
be felt” by either adults with typical speech (DSM-5) or
PWS. Despite the reported incidence of heightened fear or
anxiety in PWS, conclusions cannot be drawn regarding
the magnitude of the response by PWS to social situations
without first defining “what would normally be felt” by
typically fluent adults without heightened anxiety, and then
comparing the responses of PWS to the responses of those
typically fluent adults and to other PWS. The next section
discusses how individuals without heightened anxiety make
decisions in everyday social situations.

Heuristics and Cognitive Biases

In the context of daily living, humans encounter

numerous social and nonsocial situations that warrant an
appropriate response to avoid social stigma or ostracism.
These situations can be positive, negative, or ambiguous.
The number and variety of situations encountered require
constant information processing, judgment making, and

being equipped with cognitive processes for interpreting
new and uncertain information, people without heightened
anxiety do not form generalizations or make predictions in
ways that statistics or logic would suggest. Instead, individ-
uals make quick, intuitive judgments—called heuristics—
about situations in their daily lives on the basis of their
experience. The way in which individuals retrieve informa-
tion is heavily dependent upon those aspects of the encoun-
ter that are most salient to them personally (Mayer, 1983;
Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). Heuristics allow for rapid,
dynamic decision making and are often successful short
cuts to problem solving (Kahneman, 2011). However,
heuristics can lead to errors in decision making; these judg-
ment errors are referred to as cognitive biases. Cognitive
biases occur when evaluating all types of problems, from
the important (e.g., when making medical decisions; Hall,
2002) to the mundane (e.g., judging whether the letter “r”
appeared most often in the first or third position of a word
in the English language; Tversky & Kahneman, 1973). In
their seminal study on heuristics and decision making,
Tversky and Kahneman (1974) identified three heuristics
that biased decisions: representativeness, availability, and
adjustment from an anchor. The representativeness heuristic
comes into play when people are asked, for example, how
representative or probable a given situation is in relation to
others. The availability heuristic occurs when persons judge
the easiest-to-remember events as the most frequent or
plausible. Anchoring is involved in number estimation; it
occurs when numeric estimates are influenced by numbers
(i.e., anchors) that are not related to the task at hand.

Many additional heuristics have been identified in
the literature, and research indicates that individuals use
many different social heuristics when evaluating social situ-
ations (Bauman & Skitka, 2010; Chambers & Windschitl,
2004; Ross, Amabile, & Steinmetz, 1977). Although social
heuristics are often helpful in making quick social deci-
sions, they can lead to inaccurate judgments in social per-
ception (Kumbasar, Romney, & Batchelder, 1994), just
as decision-making heuristics do. These inaccurate social
decisions have the potential to lead to social stereotyping
(Snyder, Tanke, & Berscheid, 1977). Therefore, the accu-
racy of judgments within social situations is paramount
because social decision making drives professional and
personal relationships. Accurate judgment within social
contexts can lead to more fulfilling social interactions
and better behavioral outcomes. On the other hand, quick
decisions that lead to cognitive biases can negatively
affect social interactions and the behavioral outcomes
of those interactions (Hall, 2002; Schwab, 2008).

Relationship Between SAD and Information
Processing Biases

Although all humans are susceptible to biases that

influence their decision making, individuals with SAD often
have cognitive biases that lead to inaccurate evaluations of
social events and responses that are out of proportion to

what would typically be experienced in the general popula-
tion (DSM-5). This can result in erroneous decision making
within social situations and the perpetuation of content-
specific anxiety. The issue remaining to be investigated is
the nature of the cognitive biases that ultimately lead to
these inaccurate evaluations of social events.

Heinrichs and Hofmann (2001) suggested four under-

lying mechanisms in SAD: attention bias, memory bias,
interpretation bias, and judgment bias. These mechanisms
not only influence how individuals with social anxiety pro-
cess social information as threatening, but, on the basis
of the responsiveness to treatment, they are also causally
implicated in SAD (Amir & Bomyea, 2010; Taylor & Alden,
2010). That is, if these mechanisms are amenable to treat-
ment, the threat perception of social information and social
anxiety is decreased. Recent research in the stuttering dis-
orders literature highlights the implication that these mech-
anisms may be present in individuals living with a stutter
and are ultimately manifest in lack of social engagement
and self-stigma (Boyle, 2013).

Attention Bias

Persons with SAD exhibit attention biases toward
threatening stimuli, in that they attend more readily to
socially threatening stimuli compared with other types of
information (Amir & Bomyea, 2010). This bias toward
threatening information has been observed in both persons
with SAD and PWS using a modified Stroop task, where
both groups named the color of socially threatening words
(e.g., failure) significantly more slowly than neutral words
(e.g., session) when reaction time of responses was compared
with typical fluent, control participants without heightened
anxiety (Amir, Freshman, & Foa, 2002; Heinrichs &
Hofmann, 2001; Hennessey, Dourado, & Beilby, 2014;
Hope, Rapee, Heimberg, & Dombeck, 1990). In addition,
for individuals with SAD, attention bias for threatening
stimuli has also been observed in probe detection tasks and
in facial-recognition, face-in-the-crowd investigations (Amir,
Elias, Klumpp, & Przeworski, 2003; Gilboa-Schechtman,
Foa, & Amir, 1999; Musa, Lépine, Clark, Mansell, &
Ehlers, 2003). A recent study comparing attention bias in
adult PWS without heightened anxiety and a group of con-
trol subjects with typical speech (Lowe et al., 2016) found
no between-group differences in overall attention bias. How-
ever, within the PWS group, trait anxiety scores were cor-
related with attention toward negative faces. Similar evidence
of attention bias for sad faces has been demonstrated in chil-
dren who stutter (McAllister, Kelman, & Millard, 2015).
It is important to note that these attention biases

toward threatening stimuli appear to be amenable to treat-
ment. Individuals with social anxiety demonstrate decreased
attention to threatening stimuli after treatment (Pishyar,
Harris, & Menzies, 2008; Schmidt, Richey, Buckner, &
Timpano, 2009; Tobon, Ouimet, & Dozois, 2011).

Memory Bias

Individuals experiencing SAD may have further dif-
ficulties that affect their social engagement and quality of

500 American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology (cid:127) Vol. 26 (cid:127) 498–510 (cid:127) May 2017

Individuals with SAD encode and recall socially threaten-
ing information differently from other types of information
(Amir, Coles, Brigidi, & Foa, 2001; Ledley & Heimberg,
2006). More specifically, Amir, Foa, and Coles (2000)
found that individuals with SAD demonstrate a memory
bias for socially threatening sentences. Other studies that
have used social and nonsocial word categories or facial
expressions of positive and negative emotions have shown
findings supportive of a memory bias toward socially
threatening information in individuals with SAD (Amir,
Bower, Briks, & Freshman, 2003; Amir et al., 2001). To
date, there has been no research addressing the possibility
of memory bias for socially threatening information in PWS.
However, clinical experience provides anecdotal informa-
tion that PWS may recall socially threatening informa-
tion differently than other types of social or nonsocial
information.

Interpretation Bias

Social situations can be positive, negative, or ambig-
uous. In order to be diagnosed with SAD, the individual’s
fear or anxiety in response to a variety of social situations
must be disproportionate to the actual threat involved in
the situation (DSM-5). This could be manifest in a variety
of ways; for example, an individual with social anxiety
might misinterpret ambiguous events as threatening (Amir,
Foa, & Coles, 1998), or they might misinterpret positive
events as negative. Interpretation bias has been measured
in SAD using a variety of methodologies, including written
social scenarios; video vignettes; and photos representing
neutral, positive, and negative emotions or social events
(Amir, Beard, & Przeworski, 2005; Richards et al., 2002;
Stopa & Clark, 2000; Voncken, Bögels, & deVries, 2003).
Taken together, studies indicate that individuals with
social anxiety interpret positive and negative social events
significantly more negatively (Alden, Taylor, Mellings, &
Laposa, 2008; Voncken et al., 2003), or even catastrophi-
cally (Stopa & Clark, 2000), compared with those of control
participants.

As with attention biases, treatment of interpretation
biases can significantly reduce anxiety in individuals with
heightened anxiety (Hallion & Ruscio, 2011). The popu-
lation of adults living with a stuttering disorder has been
shown to experience heightened anxiety in social, voca-
tional, and public speaking situations (Ezrati-Vinacour &
Levin, 2004; Siegel & Haugen, 1964; Yaruss, 2007), so it
is worth investigating to ascertain if similar interpretation
bias may be present in PWS. If PWS exhibit interpretation
biases, these biases should be amenable to treatment, just
as they are in typically fluent persons with heightened
anxiety.

Judgment Bias

Judgment bias is another contributing factor to the

disproportionate anxiety toward social situations observed
in persons with SAD. Judgment bias occurs when persons
overestimate the probability that a negative event will

occur and exaggerate the negative consequences or cost
should the event occur (Foa, Franklin, Perry, & Herbert,
1996). Individuals with SAD demonstrate higher estimates
of probability and cost to social threats when compared
with controls without heightened anxiety and to popula-
tions with other disorders, such as persons with depression
(Butler & Mathews, 1983; Lucock & Salkovskis, 1988;
Voncken, Bögels, & Peeters, 2007; Voncken et al., 2003).
Voncken et al. (2003) developed the Interpretation and
Judgmental Questionnaire (IJQ) and quantified judgment
bias by calculating a “threat score” (multiplying ratings
of perceived likelihood and perceived cost of various social
and nonsocial events). They found increased estimates of
threat for different types of social events in persons with
SAD compared with controls without heightened anxiety.
As with attention and interpretation biases, judgment bias
has been a focus of various treatments in persons with SAD.
Decreased judgment bias has been documented following
safety behavior reduction, exposure therapy (Taylor &
Alden, 2010), and cognitive behavior therapy (Moscovitch
et al., 2012).

Aims and Hypotheses of the Present Study

Despite the potential relevance for PWS, neither
interpretation bias nor judgment bias has been extensively
investigated in this population. It is relevant to study judg-
ment bias in PWS for two reasons. First, if PWS exhibit
SAD, knowledge of the underlying mechanisms that drive
SAD would be useful for broadening the theoretical con-
structs underpinning this disorder. Second, positive treat-
ment outcomes have been demonstrated for persons with
SAD. If PWS exhibit similar judgment biases, then expand-
ing current behavioral and cognitive treatment techniques
to include therapies and support addressing these issues
may improve the prognosis for long-term durability of ther-
apeutic gains over time. This study investigated judgment
bias in social situations. In particular, our research ques-
tions included the following items:

2.

3.

Across all types of social situations, is the threat
associated with social situations—relative to nonsocial
situations—greater for PWS than for persons who do
not stutter (PWNS) who do not exhibit heightened
anxiety?

Do PWS and controls without heightened anxiety
differ in their estimates of threat for different types
of social situations (e.g., positive, ambiguous, mildly
negative, and profoundly negative)?

For PWS, does FNE moderate threat scores for
different types of social situations?

It is hypothesized that if persons who stutter exhibit

characteristics similar to those of individuals with SAD
(namely, FNE and trait anxiety), they may overestimate
the probability and cost for social situations, as evidenced
by an increased threat score for social situations compared
with nonsocial situations. In addition, such individuals

more than negative nonsocial events, when compared
with age- and gender-matched controls with typical speech.
Furthermore, these individuals could also overestimate
the cost of ambiguous and negative social events (Carleton,
Collimore, & Asmundson, 2010) when compared with
control participants. This overestimation of probability
and cost of social versus nonsocial situations would rep-
resent a reaction that is out of proportion to the threat of
the situation.

Method
Participants

Two groups of participants were recruited for the

study. Fifty PWS and 45 control participants with typical
speech who were age-matched and gender-matched to the
PWS group were recruited. These two groups are described
next, and demographic characteristics are summarized in
Table 1.

PWS Group

In total, 50 PWS (38 men, 12 women) with a median
age of 33 years participated in the study. This gender ratio
of 4:1 males to females is consistent with that reported
in the literature and therefore constitutes a representative
sample of adults who stutter (Manning, 2010).

Participants were recruited from the Curtin Univer-

sity Stuttering Treatment Clinic in Perth, Australia; the
George Washington University Speech and Hearing Clinic
in Washington, D.C.; the National Stuttering Association
Chapters local to the Washington, D.C., area; the National
Stuttering Association Annual Conference in Washington,
D.C.; the Speak Easy Association of Australia; and snow-
ball sampling of PWS and PWNS participants. Two certi-

stuttering, confirmed the stuttering diagnosis of all partici-
pants (the first author in the United States, and the third
author in Australia).

PWS participants self-reported attending treatment

for 0–2 years (n = 16; 32%), 3–5 years (n = 8, 16%), 6–
10 years (n = 3, 6%), greater than 10 years (n = 6, 12%),
or not at all (n = 7, 14%); 10 PWS did not report their
treatment history (20%). Of those who participated in
treatment, 26% reported using fluency shaping, 11%
reported using stuttering modification, 20% reported ex-
perience with a combination of techniques, and 43% did
not specify a treatment type. All participants reported the
absence of diagnoses of general anxiety disorder, psychiat-
ric disorders, or any speech or language disorder other
than stuttering. The majority (90%) of participants were
not currently receiving treatment.

Control Group With Typical Speech

The control group (PWNS) consisted of 45 adults

(31 males, 14 females) with a median age of 33 years who
had no experimenter-observed or self-reported speech or
communication difficulties. The PWNS participants were
recruited via flyers at the George Washington University
and Curtin University campuses, and by snowball sampling
of the PWS participants. The PWNS participants were age-
matched to PWS participants to within 6 years of age.
That is, participants in the control group were within 6 years
of age of members of the comparison group described
above. All participants reported the absence of diagnoses of
general anxiety disorder, psychiatric disorders, or any speech
or language disorder.

The PWS and PWNS groups did not differ in age

(U = 1,043, p = .77). To assess whether educational attain-
ment was similar in both groups, we quantified educational
attainment as follows: less than high school = 10 years, high
school diploma = 12 years, bachelor’s degree = 16 years,
and all advanced degrees = 18 years. The two groups did
not differ in educational attainment (U = 994.5, p = .29).

Self-Report Measures

All participants completed three self-report measures:

the Fear of Negative Evaluation (FNE; Watson & Friend,
1969), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait Scale (STAI;
Spielberger, Gorsuch, Lushene, Vagg, & Jacobs, 1983), and
the Interpretation and Judgmental Questionnaire (IJQ;
Voncken et al., 2003).

The FNE is a 30-item questionnaire that measures
respondent’s concern for perceptions of other people in
social situations. Respondents answered true or false for
statements such as, “I feel very upset when I commit some
social error” and “Other people’s opinions of me do not
bother me.” Scores are determined by assigning a value
of 1 to each item answered that matches the key (17 true
items) and reporting a sum ranging from 0 to 30. The
FNE was normed on 297 men and women without any
known clinical pathology; the mean score of the FNE was
13.97 for males and 16.1 for females in this sample (Watson

Downloaded from: https://pubs.asha.org Michigan State University on 11/10/2025, Terms of Use: https://pubs.asha.org/pubs/rights_and_permissions & Friend, 1969). Scores of 18 or above are in the top 25%
of the distribution of FNE scores. The authors suggest that
persons exhibiting FNE scores of 18 or above “might be
expected to be most affected by the possibility of disapproval”
(p. 454). The FNE has a high level of internal consistency,
with Kuder-Richardson coefficient (KR-20) values between
.92 and .94 (Leary, 1991); the Kuder-Richardson coefficient
is a recognized measure of internal consistency for items
with a dichotomous scale (Cortina, 1993).

The STAI-T (Spielberger et al., 1983) is a standard-
ized self-assessment of respondents’ perceived overall anxi-
ety levels. Respondents rate 20 self-descriptions such as “I
am content” on a scale from 1 (almost never) to 4 (almost
always), with higher scores indicating the absence of anxi-
ety, and “I lack self-confidence” on the same scale, with
higher scores indicating the presence of anxiety. Responses
for anxiety-absent items are reversed and then summed
with the anxiety-present responses, resulting in a trend for
higher sums to reflect greater trait anxiety. Scores can
range from 20 to 80. Spielberger et al. (1983) reported the
average scores for typical males (M = 34.89; SD = 9.19),
typical females (M = 34.79; SD = 9.22), and male neuro-
psychiatric patients (M = 46.62; SD = 12.41) and good
correlation with other widely used anxiety scales such as
the Beck Anxiety Inventory (Beck & Steer, 1993).

Interpretation and Judgmental Questionnaire (IJQ)

The IJQ (Voncken et al., 2003) has good internal

consistency and an intraclass coefficient (ICC) of .88
(Voncken et al., 2007). The IJQ discriminates between
persons with social phobia and/or depression from those
who do not exhibit these disorders (Voncken et al., 2003,
2007). The IJQ quantifies interpretation and judgment
bias for 24 situations ranging from profoundly negative
(e.g., “A friend tells you that a colleague dislikes you.”),
to mildly negative (e.g., “The newly introduced person
doesn’t say anything to you.”), to ambiguous (e.g., “Some-
body you know looks in your direction.”), to positive
(e.g., “Someone makes a compliment about your looks.”).
Part I presents the participants with 20 social situations
(e.g., “You are with a group of people. When you start
talking, nobody looks at you.”) and four nonsocial situa-
tions (e.g., “There is a lot of money debited from your bank
account. However, you have never given this order.”). Par-
ticipants are asked to provide written responses to ques-
tions associated with social situations (i.e., “Why is nobody
looking at you?”) and nonsocial situations (i.e., “What do
you think will happen to your money?”). Data from this
section are not reported here.

In Part II, participants are presented with the same
24 situations and four possible interpretations specific to
each situation. For each situation, there is one profoundly
negative, one mildly negative, one neutral, and one positive
interpretation. Participants are asked to read the situation
and complete three different ratings. In this study, partici-
pants were asked to rank the four possible interpretations
from the most probable to least probable, using the number

“1” to indicate the most probable, “2” to indicate the next
most probable, and so on. Next, participants used a visual-
analog (VA) scale to rate the probability or likelihood
that the worst-case scenario would occur in that situation.
To rate probability, participants read each scenario and
then placed a vertical line on the VA scale anchored from
0% on the left to 100% on the right. For example, partici-
pants used a VA scale to indicate the following: “How prob-
able do you think it is that they really don’t want you in
the group because they don’t think you are interesting?”
VA ratings were measured in millimeters from the left an-
chor (i.e., from 0%) using a ruler. Last, participants used
a VA scale to rate the cost or severity of the consequence
for themselves in the event of the worst-case scenario. To
rate cost, participants read each scenario and then placed
a vertical line on a second VA scale anchored from not bad
at all on the left to very bad on the right. For example,
participants used this VA scale to indicate the following:
“How bad would it be for you if they really don’t want you
in the group because they don’t think you are interesting?”
VA ratings were measured in millimeters from the left
anchor (i.e., from “not bad at all”) using a ruler.

Scoring the IJQ
Calculating Threat Scores

The IJQ consists of 20 social situations (five each of
ambiguous, profoundly negative, mildly negative, and pos-
itive) and four nonsocial situations. A Threat score was
calculated for each of the 24 situations for each participant
by multiplying the probability and cost VA values and
then multiplying the product by 100, per the original IJQ
scoring instructions (Voncken et al., 2003). The 20 social
threat scores were summed to yield a Total Social Threat
score. The four nonsocial threat scores were summed to
yield a Total Nonsocial Threat score.

To calculate a threat score for each type of social

situation, the threat scores for each of the situations were
summed and then divided by 5 to arrive at a threat score
for that specific social situation (e.g., probability + cost for
all ambiguous situations/5 ambiguous situations = threat
score for ambiguous social situations). This procedure
yielded perceived threat scores for ambiguous, profoundly
negative, mildly negative, and positive social situations.

Calculating Threat Ratio Scores

In order to quantify if participants’ responses were
“out of proportion” to what is typically felt, an Overall
Threat Ratio for each participant was calculated by divid-
ing his/her Total Social Threat score by his/her Total Non-
social Threat score. By using a ratio, participants served
as their own controls, allowing for individual differences
in how people react to perceived threats in different situa-
tions. Threat ratios were also calculated for each type of
social situation by dividing the Total Threat score for the
situation by the Total Nonsocial Threat score (e.g., threat
score for ambiguous situations/total nonsocial threat score =
threat ratio for ambiguous situations). It was deemed

absence of normative values for threat scores for each social
situation, and the hypothesis was that the threat ratios for
PWNS would be lower than the threat ratios for PWS.

groups.

Procedures

This study was approved by the Curtin University

Human Research Ethics Committee and The George
Washington University Institutional Review Board. After
reviewing an information sheet about the study and ver-
bally consenting to participate in the study, all participants
completed a brief demographic interview with an investi-
gator, who documented the participant’s demographic
information, prior treatment, and verified the presence or
absence of stuttering. Participants then completed the FNE,
STAI-T, and IJQ questionnaires in randomized order.

Data Coding

Demographic information and participant responses
for the FNE and STAI-T were recorded in a spreadsheet.
Scoring of the FNE and STAI-T followed the original test
instructions. Data entry was verified for FNE and STAI-T
scores, and disagreements were resolved by reference to
original test documents. Interrater reliability for IJQ visual–
analog scoring (described above) was obtained by a second
judge. This judge was in agreement with the visual–analog
probability and cost measurements of the first judge 96% of
the time.

Results
Power Calculations

We performed an a priori power calculation using

G*Power (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, & Buchner, 2007), setting
our desired power at .80 for our anticipated calculations.
In order to detect an effect size of .8, with a two-tailed test
and α = .05, 52 participants (n = 26 per group) were needed.
However, visual inspection of the obtained Total Social
Threat, Total Nonsocial Threat, and Overall Threat Ratio
scores revealed nonnormal distributions for each of these
variables for all groups, and this was verified by SPSS. As a
result, nonparametric statistics were used for calculations.
We then performed a post-hoc analysis of achieved power,
using G*Power and rules for calculating power for non-
parametric statistics (Lehmann, 1975). Post-hoc analysis
achieved power was .97 (with an effect size of .8, two-tailed
test, α = .05, and two groups of n = 50 and n = 45). All
statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 22
(IBM Corporation, 2013).

Comparing PWS and PWNS Groups

Medians for FNE and STAI-T scores for the PWS

(n = 50) and PWNS (n = 45) groups are in Table 2. A Mann–
Whitney test revealed a significant difference in FNE scores
(U = 1,456, p = .007). The PWS group exhibited significantly

higher FNE scores. The two groups did not differ in STAI-T
score (U = 1,247, p = .27).

Table 3 contains median threat scores for the PWS
and PWNS groups. A Mann–Whitney U test revealed no
significant differences between groups in Total Social Threat
scores (U = 1,101, p = .99), Total Nonsocial Threat scores
(U = 871, p = .08), or Overall Threat Ratio (U = 1,252,
p = .13). Taken together, these findings suggest that, as a
group, PWS and PWNS do not differ in their reactions to
social situations. However, both groups had a subset of
participants with FNE scores in the top 25% of the score
distribution (Watson & Friend, 1969). In order to address
research question 3, we decided to divide the PWS group
into two groups, one with high FNE and one with low FNE,
and compare their threat scores with the subset of PWNS
with FNE scores in the typical range (procedures described
below).

Assigning Participants to Groups According
to FNE Scores

The participants were placed into three groups accord-
ing to their stuttering status and scores on the FNE (Watson
and Friend, 1969). The 50 participants in the PWS group
were divided into two experimental groups on the basis of
their FNE scores (see Table 4). The 24 PWS with FNE
scores of 18 or higher were placed in the PWS–High FNE
group, as these scores are in the top 25% of the distribution
of FNE scores in the normative sample (Watson & Friend,
1969). The PWS–High FNE group (19 men, 5 women)
ranged in age from 18 to 70 years. The median STAI-T
score for this group was 49, indicating elevated trait anxiety.
The 26 PWS with FNE scores below 18 were placed
in the PWS–Low FNE group. The PWS–Low FNE group

Overall Threat Ratio Scores Between
the Three Groups

(19 men, 7 women) ranged in age from 20 to 64 years. The
median STAI-T score for this group was 36.0, indicating
self-perceived anxiety in the typical range.

The PWNS group was divided into two groups on the
basis of their FNE scores. The 35 PWNS (24 men, 11 women)
participants who had FNE scores below 18 (median = 8.00,
indicating low fear of negative evaluation) were placed in the
PWNS control group with typical anxiety. This group had
a median age of 33 years. The median STAI-T score for the
PWNS group was 36, indicating self-perceived anxiety in the
typical range. The 10 remaining PWNS (7 men, 3 women)
participants had high FNE scores and were excluded from
further analyses, as our research questions were concerned
with comparing PWS to control participants with typical anx-
iety who did not stutter.

Visual inspection of the FNE and STAI-T scores

revealed nonnormal distributions for each of these variables
for all three groups, and this was verified by SPSS. As a
result, nonparametric statistics were used for calculations.
A Kruskal–Wallis test revealed significant differences in FNE
scores between groups, H(2) = 51.46, p = .001. Follow-up
pairwise comparisons (with Bonferroni correction) revealed
significant differences in FNE scores between the PWNS
and PWS–High FNE groups (U = 6.78, p = .001), and be-
tween the PWS–High FNE and PWS–Low FNE groups
(U = −5.68, p = .001). The FNE scores of the PWNS and
the PWS–Low FNE groups were not significantly different
( p = .50).

A Kruskal–Wallis test revealed significant differences

in STAI-T scores between the three groups, H(2) = 24.32,
p = .001. Follow-up pairwise comparisons (with Bonfer-
roni correction) revealed significant differences in STAI-T
scores between the PWNS and PWS–High FNE groups
(U = 4.00, p = .001), and between the PWS–High FNE
and PWS–Low FNE groups (U = −4.61, p = .001). The
STAI-T scores of the PWNS and the PWS–Low FNE
groups were not significantly different ( p = .32).

Total Threat Scores Between the Three Groups

Medians for the three groups for Total Social Threat
score and Total Nonsocial Threat score are given in Table 5.
A Kruskal–Wallis test revealed significant differences in

Medians for Overall Threat Ratio scores for the three

groups of participants are given in Table 6. A Kruskal–
Wallis test revealed significant differences in the distribu-
tion of Overall Threat Ratio scores between PWS–High
FNE, PWS–Low FNE, and PWNS groups, H(2) = 7.19,
p = .02. Follow-up pairwise comparisons (with Bonferroni
correction, α = .05/3 = .016) revealed significant differences
in Overall Threat Ratio scores between the PWNS and
PWS–High FNE groups (U = 2.54, p = .011). No other
pairwise comparisons were significantly different.

Threat Ratio Score by Type of Situation

Median Overall Threat Ratio scores for different

types of situations for PWS–High FNE, PWS–Low FNE,
and PWNS groups are summarized in Table 6. Series of
independent-samples Kruskal–Wallis tests, with Bonferroni
correction (α = .05/4 = .013), were conducted to evaluate
differences among the three groups on the distribution
of Overall Threat Ratio scores for ambiguous, profoundly
negative, mildly negative, and positive situation types.
There were no significant differences in Overall
Threat Ratio scores between groups for ambiguous, H(2) =
4.74, p = .09, or profoundly negative, H(2) = 4.34, p = .11,
situations. These findings suggest that all three groups
found ambiguous and profoundly negative social situations
equally threatening.

There were significant differences between groups for

mildly negative social situations, H(2) = 12.26, p = .002.
Pairwise comparisons revealed that the PWS–High FNE
group had significantly higher Overall Threat Ratio scores
for mildly negative situations than the PWS–low FNE group
(U = −3.11, p = .006) and the PWNS group (U = 3.09,
p = .006) did. The Overall Threat Ratio scores for mildly
negative social situations did not differ between the PWS–
Low FNE and PWNS groups (p = .83). For mildly negative
social situations, the PWS–High FNE group reported the
highest Overall Threat Ratio scores (e.g., the most out-of-
proportion scores), followed by the PWNS group and the
PWS–Low FNE group.

There were significant differences between groups for

positive social situations, H(2) = 11.89, p = .003. Pairwise
comparisons revealed that the PWS–High FNE group had
significantly higher Overall Threat Ratio scores for posi-
tive situations than the PWS–low FNE group (U = −3.19,
p = .004) and the PWNS group (U = 2.90, p = .004) did.

lowed by the PWS–Low FNE and the PWNS groups.

Discussion

The most significant finding from the present study
is that not all PWS exhibit judgment bias for social situa-
tions. Social Threat scores and Overall Threat Ratios were
similar for our two large groups of PWS and PWNS. It
was only when the PWS group was divided on the basis of
FNE score that group differences emerged: PWS with high
FNE scores reported Overall Threat Ratios that were sig-
nificantly higher than those for PWNS group that showed
typical anxiety. This suggests that the presence of high FNE,
as opposed to the clinical diagnosis of stuttering, may be a
contributing factor for fear or anxiety that is “out of propor-
tion to what would normally be felt” (DSM-5). Because the
responses of the PWS with low FNE group mirrored those
of the PWNS adults without heightened anxiety, judgment
bias itself does not appear to be a perpetuating factor of fear
or anxiety in all PWS.

the three groups (PWS–High FNE, PWS–Low FNE, and
PWNS) did not differ in threat ratio scores for ambiguous
and profoundly negative social situations, suggesting that
all three of the groups, regardless of FNE and STAI-T
score, find these types of social situations high in perceived
threat.

These findings highlight the need to be mindful of
the nature of the comparison group when characterizing
the magnitude of judgment bias in a given client who
stutters. Comparison to population norms, when they be-
come available, will allow SLPs to decide if their client’s
performance is out of proportion to that of the general
population. Comparing a given client’s performance to
that of other PWS allows clinicians to define their client’s
“individual strengths and weaknesses and areas in need of
treatment/accommodation” (Strauss, Sherman, & Spreen,
2006, p. 47), as long as “the severity and nature of the
impairments” match those of the client (Brookshire &
McNeil, 2015, p. 72). Although SLPs cannot diagnose the
presence of SAD, they can address clients’ affective, behav-
ioral, and cognitive reactions to communicative situations
when providing treatment.

may be a determining factor for the ways in which PWS
approach different types of social situations. For example,
in PWS who also exhibit high FNE, a therapy program
that fails to assess and manage FNE evaluation is not
assisting the individual who stutters with managing the
challenges in their daily social living. In contrast, in PWS
with low FNE, it would be inefficient to use valuable treat-
ment time addressing FNE.

All PWS, regardless of FNE status, consider ambigu-
ous and profoundly negative situations equally threatening,
which is in contrast to many traditional theories of social
anxiety (Carleton et al., 2010; Foa et al., 1996). This find-
ing has implications for stuttering treatment programs that
use situational hierarchies of increasing speaking difficulty
(Manning, 2010). Such hierarchies are often used in sys-
tematic desensitization and to assist in generalization of
therapy gains (Manning, 2010). The findings of the current
study suggest that profoundly negative situations may not
lead to reactions that are out of proportion for most PWS.
PWS with high and low FNE as well as persons with typi-
cal anxiety who do not stutter estimate similar probability
and cost values for ambiguous and profoundly negative
social situations, and because PWS do not overestimate
probability and cost for profoundly negative situations, there
may not be a benefit in practicing these specific types of
situations. It is interesting to note that the supposedly less
threatening scenarios (i.e., mildly negative and positive)
engendered differences in perceived threat between groups,
suggesting that these types of scenarios may prove to be
fertile ground for practicing fear-reduction strategies. PWS
with high FNE interpret these types of scenarios more neg-
atively than PWS with low FNE and PWNS. However,
PWS with high FNE may exhibit interpretation biases simi-
lar to those reported for persons with SAD (Voncken et al.,
2003). This finding warrants further exploration if positive
treatment outcomes are to be integrated into daily living
and sustained long term in PWS. Cognitive biases exhibited
in persons with SAD are amenable to treatment and result
in effective therapeutic outcomes in the reduction of charac-
teristics perpetuating social anxiety (Moscovitch et al., 2012;
Pishyar, et al., 2008; Taylor & Alden, 2010; Tobon, et al.,
2011); it seems reasonable to explore the usefulness of such
treatments in PWS who exhibit high FNE. Work has begun
in this area, and a general cognitive behavior therapy pro-
gram was successful in reducing characteristics of social
phobia in a group of PWS (Menzies et al., 2008).

The results from this study, specifically, the key find-
ings of significantly higher overall threat scores and higher
threat scores for mildly negative and positive social situa-
tions for PWS with high FNE, underscore the rationale
for integrated holistic treatment approaches supporting
the positive management of stuttering beyond the surface
speech changes. Manning (2010) suggested that true effica-
cious therapy is positive therapy that is built on successes
beyond the person’s typography of stuttered speech. Thus,
if PWS exhibit out-of-proportion responses to social situa-
tions, then these responses make reasonable treatment targets.

In contrast, if PWS evaluate certain types of social situa-
tions in the same way as individuals with typical speech
and typical anxiety, then therapy should not highlight these
situations. It is unrealistic to expose clients to situations
and insist on challenges beyond those that typical adults
embrace.

There is new wave of contemporary treatments that
integrates positive social engagement with fluency strate-
gies known as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT;
Beilby & Byrnes, 2012; Beilby, Byrnes, & Yaruss, 2012).
The findings in the current study provide an endorsement for
this future treatment direction that supports values-based
decisions, mindfulness, and exploration of experiential avoid-
ance. Such an integrated future therapeutic paradigm pro-
motes awareness and understanding of the context for the
speaker rather than targeting direct changes to the content of
thought in and of itself (Beilby et al., 2012). A recent com-
parison of treatments mediating social anxiety indicated that
the rate of change for improved experiential avoidance is a
mechanism specific to ACT and not cognitive behavior ther-
apy in general (Niles et al., 2014). ACT provides strategies
to decrease judgment bias and “diffuse” the individual
from their disorder. That is, following ACT, the person no
longer defines themselves according to their problem, but
chosen outcomes are directed at values-based living instead
(Hayes, Luoma, Bond, Masuda, & Lillis, 2006).

SAD and FNE respond to holistic ACT in that ACT

addresses the responses in the individual’s mindset that
are indeed negative and “out of proportion” to the actual-
ity of the situation. ACT can improve social engagement
by directly managing experiential avoidance on the part
of the speaker (Hayes et al., 2004). Avoidance may be at
different levels for PWS (i.e., word avoidance, situation
avoidance, or the lack of or restriction of social interaction).
In general, ACT focuses on trying to increase psychologi-
cal flexibility, defined by Hayes et al. (2006, p. 7) as “the
ability to contact the present moment more fully as a con-
scious human being, and to change or persist in behaviour
when doing so serves valued ends.” Research analyzing ACT
treatment with PWS has implemented six core processes to
manage and increase psychological flexibility: self-concept,
diffusion, acceptance, mindfulness, values, and committed
action (Beilby & Byrnes, 2012). The results are promising in
terms of an integrated treatment that provides fluency sup-
port while concurrently improving engagement and reduc-
ing the burden of the stuttering disorder (Beilby, Byrnes,
& Yaruss, 2012).

Limitations and Future Directions

A recent meta-analysis by Craig and Tran (2014)

suggested that higher levels of trait and social anxiety pre-
dominate in PWS. Some of the PWS participants in the
current study exhibited high FNE and trait anxiety, similar
to those reported by Craig and Tran. However, half of
the PWS group in the current study, in fact, did not exhibit
high FNE or trait anxiety scores. The majority (90%) of
participants in the present study reported that they were

recruited from self-help organizations across the United
States and Australia. Individuals participating in protective
activities, such as social support networks, are likely to
increase psychological resilience and improve quality of life
(Boyle, 2015). Additional factors contributing to resilience
in PWS include increased self-efficacy and healthy social
functioning, and these factors are related to lower levels
of psychopathology (Craig, Blumgart, & Tran, 2011). In-
creased self-efficacy, social support, and healthy social
functioning through participation in self-help groups may
have influenced the responses of our participants who stut-
ter. Thus, the findings of the current study cannot be gen-
eralized to PWS who do not participate in protective activities
such as those noted above.

An additional limitation of the current study is that
the effects of high FNE and high trait anxiety scores can-
not be separated. That is, the PWS with high FNE scores
also reported high trait anxiety. It would be interesting,
though perhaps difficult, to study PWS who have high
FNE but report low trait anxiety, to see if the judgment
biases noted in the current study pertain to that group
as well. This would allow for a more detailed analysis of
the possible mediating effects of FNE and trait anxiety on
judgment bias in PWS. Other researchers have also noted
the need to include PWS with high and low social anxiety
in future studies of possible underlying biases of social
anxiety in PWS (Lowe et al., 2016). In addition, comparing
PWS to groups of PWNS with high FNE, as well as to
PWNS with clinical diagnoses of SAD, might prove fruit-
ful in describing possible subtle differences in social percep-
tions in these groups.

Future research should distinguish PWS with high

and low FNE in order to accurately identify and ultimately
support each of these different groups of PWS. Research
questions should address any differences between these groups
with respect to other cognitive biases and with respect to
their general attitudes in approaching different social situa-
tions. Investigating cognitive biases exhibited by PWS, such
as disparate or faulty attention (Hennessey et al., 2014;
Lowe et al., 2016) or interpretation bias, may be a significant
adjunct for successful therapeutic outcomes and engage-
ment for adults living with stuttered speech.

Conclusion

The findings of the present study indicate that not all
PWS exhibit an out-of-proportion response to social situa-
tions. The magnitude of the responses varies as a function
of FNE. PWS with high FNE evaluation report signifi-
cantly higher threat scores for certain types of social situa-
tions compared with PWS with low FNE evaluation and
when compared with PWNS controls.
