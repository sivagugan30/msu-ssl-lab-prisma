Purpose:  Research  indicates  that  there  is  a  tendency  for  females  who  stutter, 
more  often  than  males,  to  use  coping  strategies  that 
involve  covering  their 
stutter,  for  example,  by  avoiding  situations  that  require  verbal  participation.

Method:  Eleven  young  women  who  stutter  covertly  were  interviewed,  and  data 
were  subjected  to  qualitative  content  analysis.  Background 
information  was 
obtained  from  the  self-report  instruments  measuring  the  impact  of  stuttering  on 
(Overall  Assessment  of  the  Speaker’s  Experiences  of 
different  aspects  of 
Stuttering)  and  degree  of  perceived  social  anxiety 
(Liebowitz  Social  Anxiety 
Scale,  Self-Report). 
Results:  Three  main  themes  were  identified:  (a)  managing  stuttering,  (b)  personal 
aspects,  and  (c)  stuttering  as  a  phenomenon.  Shame  and  a  desire  to  fit  in  emerged 
as  distinct  motives  for  covering  stuttering.  The  women  described  that  stuttering 
controlled  both  life  choices  and  everyday  life.  Development  of  self-image  had  been 
strongly  negatively  affected,  resulting  in  social  anxiety.  The  women  expressed  a 
particular  vulnerability  of  being  a  woman  who  stutters,  due  to  societal  norms  of 
female  behavior  and  a  lack  of  female  role  models  who  stutter. 
Conclusions:  The  choice  of  coping  strategy  was  motivated  by  a  desire  to  “be 
normal.”  As  a result,
 stuttering  had  come to dominate life and  affect  self-
image  and 
importance  for  clinicians  to 
be  alert  to  and  aware  of  the  fact  that  the  experiences  of  women  who  stutter

involves  much  more  than  the  disruptions  in  the  flow  of 
speech,  but  also 
involves  various  reactions  that  occur 
because  of  stuttering  (Tichenor  et  al.,  2022).  The  reac-
tions  may  include  emotional,  behavioral,  and  cognitive 
factors,  for  example,  feelings  of  fear  and  embarrassment, 
avoidance  of  words  or  situations,  and  rumination  and 
negative  thinking  (Tichenor  &  Yaruss,  2019).

It  has  also  been  shown  that  stuttering  elicits  negative 
listeners’  reactions  (Craig  &  Tran,  2014;  Eggers  et  al., 
2022;  Iverach  et  al.,  2011;  Iverach,  Jones,  et  al.,  2009; 
Iverach,  O’Brian,  et  al.,  2009;  Iverach  &  Rapee,  2014; 
Tran  et  al.,  2011).  An  accumulation  of  negative  experi-
ences  often  leads  to  an  increase  in  anxiety  and  avoidance 
of  social  situations  (Craig  &  Tran,  2006;  Tran  et  al., 
2011).  It  is  well-established  in  the  literature  that  anxiety 
and  anxiety-related  disorders  (i.e.,  social  phobia)  are  com-
mon 
likely  attribut-
able,  at  least  in  part,  to  the  social  penalties  associated  with 
the  disorder.

Iverach  et  al.  (2017).  However,  there  is  also  evidence  point-
ing  at  a  nonlinear  relation  between  complexity  of  stuttering 
behavior  and  the  speaker’s  perception  and  reaction  to  stut-
tering  (Iverach  et  al.,  2017;  Manning  &  Gayle  Beck,  2013; 
O’Brian  et  al.,  2022;  Ward  et  al.,  2021).  Perkins  (1990)  sug-
gested  that  the  PWS  who  report  the  greatest  impact  of  stut-
tering  on  their  lives  are  those  who  rarely,  or  ever,  allow 
others  to  see  or  hear  them  stutter.  This  notion  is  in  turn 
consistent  with  Gerlach  et  al.  (2021)  who  suggest  that  con-
cealment  of  stuttering  is  a  strong  predictor  of  psychological 
distress  and  negative  impact  of  stuttering  on  quality  of  life,

it  makes 

In  a  synthesis  of  17  qualitative  studies,  Connery 
et  al.  (2020)  found  avoidance  behavior  to  be  a  distinctive 
characteristic  of 
stuttering.  Covering  or  minimizing 
less  or  substituting 
moments  of  stuttering  by  speaking 
certain  words  or  avoiding  situations  is  technically  a  fairly 
uncomplicated  way  of  coping  with  stuttering.  Personal 
costs  may  be  great  though,  as  pointed  out  by  Douglass 
and  Quarrington  (1952),  as  it  involves  a  constant  aware-
ness  of  the  speech  difficulty,  constant  preparedness  and 
vigilance,  and  avoidance  or  heightened  vigilance 
in  all 
situations  that  may  pose  a  threat  of  possible  disclosure. 

little  attention 

Covert  stuttering  has  received 

in 
research,  although  PWS  who  manage  to  pass  as  fluent 
have  been  mentioned  in  the  literature  for  over  a  century 
(Constantino  et  al.,  2017).  The  early  publication  by 
Douglass  and  Quarrington  (1952)  provides  a  description 
of  covert  stuttering  through  the  authors’  clinical  experi-
ences  and  in  depth-interviews. 

Douglass  et  al.  (2019)  problematize  the  use  of  multi-
ple  terms  in  the  literature  to  describe  the  phenomenon— 
covert  stuttering,  covert  features,  passing  as  fluent—and 
state  that  it  may  lead  to  confusion.  The  concepts  “overt” 
and  “covert”  features  of  stuttering  are  commonly  used 

concepts,  where  overt  features  constitute  repetitions,  pro-
longations,  and  blocks,  while  covert  features  are  equiva-
lent  to  avoidance  strategies.  The  avoidance  strategies,  or 
“secondary  features  of  stuttering,”  may  consist  of  word 
substitutions,  rephrasing, 
interjections,  and  pausing,  and 
are  pervasively  used  by  PWS.  Anticipating  a  moment  of 
stuttering,  the  authors  propose,  is  an  example  of  a  covert 
feature  of  stuttering,  while  successful  concealment  of  stut-
tering  is  the  hallmark  of  a  person  with  covert  stuttering. 
Furthermore,  Douglass  et  al.  (2019)  considered  that  the 
concept  “covering”  refers  to  concealing  something  while 
“passing”  refers  to  succeeding 
in  presenting  oneself  as 
is  not,  and  based  on  this,  they  suggest 
something  one 
that  the  term  covert  stuttering  describe  moments  of  stut-
tering  that  the  speaker  consciously  hides.  Passing  as  flu-
ent,  in  turn,  refers  to  the  role  the  speaker  represents,  as 
the  distinction 
perceived  by 
between  the  concepts  may  be  subtle,  it  is  important  that 
the  concepts  are  defined  and  separated,  so  that  the  differ-
ent  experiences  are  described  as  exactly  as  possible

Additional  recent  studies  on  covert  stuttering  have 
focused  on 
subjective  experiences  of  people  who 
covertly  stutter  rather  than  the  mechanisms  that  might 
underlie  the  development  of  covert  stuttering  (Boyle  & 
Gabel,  2020a,  2020b;  Constantino  et  al.,  2017;  Douglass 
et  al.,  2018,  2019;  Douglass  &  Tetnowski,  2015).  Douglass 
and  Tetnowski  (2015)  conducted  in-depth  interviews  and

required  an  almost  constant  state  of  mental  stress  to  main-
tain  the  appearance  of  fluency  and  to  “save  face.”  The 
rationale  for  this  behavior  was  an  urge  to  preserve  dignity 
and  professional  reputation  and  minimize  humiliation  and 
embarrassment.  In  line  with  this  finding,  it  has  also  been 
suggested  that  covering  stuttering  was  a  rational  decision 
by  the  speaker  in  order  to  resist  discrimination,  delegitimi-
zation,  and  the  stigma  that  is  associated  with  having  an 
identity  of  a  PWS  (Constantino  et  al.,  2017).

experience  of  stuttering  and  choice  of  coping  strategies. 
These  variables  may  include  age,  personality  traits,  health 
status,  ethnicity,  and  cultural  background,  but  also  sex/ 
gender.  By  gender,  we  mean  socially  constructed  norms 
that  impose  and  determine  roles,  relationships,  and  posi-
tional  power  for  all  people  across  their  lifetime.  Gender 
interacts  with  sex,  the  biological  and  physical  characteris-
tics  that  define  women,  men,  and  those  with  intersex  iden-
tities,  as  defined  by  Global  Health  50/50.4  (see  Shannon 
et  al.,  2019).

ined  either  the  unique  experience  of  stuttering  for  female 
PWS  or  whether  stuttering  affects  females  and  males  dif-
ferently  (e.g.,  Feldman,  1977;  Sheehan,  1979;  Silverman, 
1980,  1986;  Silverman  &  Zimmer,  1979,  1982).  A  differ-
ence  was  suggested  between  the  sexes  in  terms  of  female 
PWS  having  higher  levels  of  self-esteem  and  a  more  posi-
tive  attitude  to  communication  compared  to  males,  but  that 
stronger  negative  stereotypes  were  associated  with  female 
PWS  (Silverman,  1980;  Silverman  &  Zimmer,  1979). 

A  small  number  of  recent  empirical  studies  have  com-
pared  differences  between  female  and  male  PWS  regarding 
adverse  impact  of  stuttering.  Adriaensens  et  al.  (2015)  and 
Iverach  et  al.  (2017)  found  that  adolescent  females,  com-
pared  to  age-matched  males,  reported  more  negative  com-
munication  attitudes,  lower  self-esteem,  a  higher  degree  of 
self-perceived  stuttering  severity  and  avoidances,  and  less 
self-control  during  speaking 
(Adriaensens  et  al.,  2015). 
Samson  et  al.  (2021,  2022)  reported  similar  findings  in  sex-
disaggregated  analyses  examining  the  experience  of  stutter-
ing.  The  overall  impact  of  stuttering  was  more  severe  for 
young  females  who  stutter  compared  to  age-matched  males. 
Females  were  also  more  likely  than  males  to  use  avoidance 
strategies  to  conceal  their  stuttering  and  were  more  emo-
tionally  affected  by  their  predicament.  Furthermore,  in  a 
longitudinal  study  by  Briley  et  al.  (2021),  it  was  concluded 
that  depressive  symptoms  increased  in  severity  with  age 
among  female  PWS,  whereas  they  remained  stable  among 
male  PWS.  Nang  et  al.  (2018)  conducted  interviews  with 
nine  women  who  stutter  and  found  that  stuttering  had  a 
pervasive  impact  on  all  domains  of  their  lives,  including 
relationships,  career  potential,  and  perception  of  self. 

Listeners’  reactions 

to  stuttered  speech  have  also 
been  found  to  differ  depending  on  whether  the  speaker  is 
listeners’ 
female  or  male.  Byrd  et  al.  (2017)  examined 
female  and  male 
reactions  after  viewing  videos  with 
speakers  who  stutter  and  found  that  female  speakers  were 
more  likely  to  be  rated  by  observers  as  having  negative 
character  traits,  for  example,  unfriendly,  shy,  and  insecure, 
compared  to  males.  Male  speakers  who  stutter  were  more 
likely  to  be  selected  by  the  listeners  as  intelligent  and  out-
going.  This  finding  was  confirmed  in  a  replication  of  the 
study  with  Israeli  listeners,  suggesting  that  negative  per-
ceptions  of  female  PWS  persist  across  culture  and 
lan-
guage  (Croft  &  Byrd,  2021). 

Moreover,  Gerlach  et  al.  (2018)  found  that  female 
PWS  suffered  more  from  occupational  penalties  (earning 
less  and  being  underemployed  to  a  greater  extent)  relative 
to  their  fluent  counterparts  compared  to  male  PWS.  This 
finding  is  in  line  with  research  from  other  disciplines  cit-
ing  that  females  who  present  with  a  disability  are  more 
likely  to  be  more  negatively  perceived  and  at  risk  for 

discrimination,  than  are  males  (Coleman  et  al.,  2015; 
Gerlach  et  al.,  2018;  Lloyd,  1992). 

The  Trajectory  of  Stuttering  in  Females 
and  Males 

Why 

the  experience  and 

impact  of  stuttering 

in 
females  so  far  have  received  limited  research  engagement  is 
probably  explained  by  the  fact  that  females  make  up  a 
much  smaller  proportion  of  the  total  number  of  PWS  due 
to  a  higher  natural  recovery  rate  in  girls  than  boys  (Yairi  & 
Ambrose,  2005),  and  therefore  are  less  likely  to  be  included 
in  research  studies.  The  overall  male-to-female  ratio  of 
PWS 
is  estimated  to  be  approximately  3:1  (Bloodstein 
et  al.,  2021).  However,  the  ratio  varies  depending  on  age. 
Craig  et  al.  (2002)  report  a  fluctuation  of  male-to-female 
ratio  over  the  life  span  with  3:1  for  a  2- to  10-year  cohort, 
4:1  for  11- to  20-year-olds,  2:1  for  individuals  between  21 
and  49  years  of  age,  and  almost  balanced  (1.4:1)  for  per-
sons  over  50  years  of  age.  Briley  et  al.  (2021)  found  that 
boys  identified  with  stuttering  by  their  parents  constituted 
most  of  a  cohort  of  children  (3–17  years  old).  Gerlach 
et  al.  (2018)  found  the  sex  ratio  for  people  aged  13– 
34  years  to  be  1.84:1.  Data  in  the  study  were  obtained 
from  a  large  population  survey  of  13,654  people  in  which 
those  who  answered  “yes”  to  the  question  “Do  you  have 
problems  with  stuttering  or  stammering?”  were  included  in 
the  calculation  of  the  sex  distribution.

The  variation  in  sex  ratio  may  be  attributed  to  differ-
ent  methodologies  used 
self-
reported,  as  in  the  work  of  Gerlach  et  al.  (2018),  or  listener 
based,  as  in  the  works  of  Craig  et  al.  (2002)  and  Briley 
et  al.  (2021).  Because  the  manifestations  of  stuttering  are 
highly  variable  and  often  overlap  with  typical  disfluencies, 
it  is  rarely  sufficient  to  rely  on  perceptual  assessment  by 
secondary  informants  (parents,  family  members,  teachers, 
etc.;  Brocklehurst,  2013).  In  addition,  there  are  significant 
aspects  of  stuttering  that  are  difficult  to  observe,  why  a 
focus  solely  on  observable  speech  behaviors  may  lead  to 
compromised  judgments  and  measures  of  stuttering  (Jackson 
et  al.,  2012).  Individuals  who  stutter  at  older  ages  may  have 
learned  to  manage  their  stuttering,  for  example,  by  avoiding 
words  or  minimizing  speech,  to  the  extent  that  they  remain 
unidentified  (Briley  et  al.,  2021).

Thus,  a  possible  explanation  for  the  sex  imbalance 
in  prevalence  of  stuttering  could  be  that  persistent  stutter-
ing  is  not  more  common  among  boys;  they  are  just  more 
likely  to  be  identified  as  persistent.  Perhaps  girls  continue 
identified  with  stuttering  because 
to  stutter  but  are  not 
they  are  concealing  it.  We  still  lack  a  more  detailed  analy-
sis  of  the  trajectory  of  stuttering  in  females  and  males  that 
can  help  us  better  understand  the  underlying  reasons  for 
the  sex  differences. 

Purpose 

Even  though  reported  incidence  of  females  who  stut-
ter  is  lower  than  in  males,  they  still  make  up  a  significant 
part  of  the  total  population  of  PWS.  Very  few  studies  of 
the  experience  of  stuttering  have  included  information  from 
women  only  (Nang  et  al.,  2018).  A  deeper  understanding  is 
warranted  of  why  females  seem  to  develop  coping  strategies 
that  involve  avoiding  and  concealing  their  stuttering  to  a 
higher  extent  than  males.  Although  recent  initiatives  have 
been  undertaken  to  investigate  aspects  of  covert  stuttering 
(e.g.,  Constantino  et  al.,  2017;  Douglass  et  al.,  2018,  2019; 
Douglass  &  Tetnowski,  2015),  there  is  still  a  need  to  con-
tinue  to  unveil  the  experiences  of  women  with  covert  stut-
the 
tering,  especially  as 
adverse  impact  of  stuttering  will  be  most  effective  if  they 
are  individualized  to  the  unique  experience  of  each  PWS 
(Tichenor  et  al.,  2022).  Therefore,  the  aim  of  this  study  was 
to  broaden  the  current  understanding  of  covert  stuttering  in 
women  by  exploring  the  behaviors  they  exhibit,  alter,  or 
avoid.  The  aims  included  investigating  the  underlying  fac-
tors  that  cause  women  who  stutter  to  hide  their  stuttering 
in  order  to  appear  fluent  and  identifying  what  the  conse-
quences  have  been  for  different  aspects  of  their  lives.

The  study  was  approved  by 

the  Ethical  Review 
Authority  in  Stockholm  in  July  2019,  Project  2019–03258. 

Participants 

Participants  were  11  women  who  stutter,  ranging  in

from  21 

to  30  years 

age 

from

speech-
language  pathologists  (SLPs)  in  different  clinics  in  Swe-
den,  self-help  groups,  and  from  personal  contacts  of  the 
in  the  Swedish 
first  author  who  has 
National  Stuttering  Association  (Stamningsförbundet).  Par-
ticipant  eligibility  criteria  included  (a)  identification  as  a 
woman,  (b)  self-reported  history  of  developmental  stutter-
ing,  (c)  self-identifying  as  a  person  who  stutters  but  who 
consciously  conceals  all  stuttering  behavior  to  maintain 
the  appearance  as  a  person  who  does  not  stutter,  (d)  age 
between  18  and  30  years,  and  (e)  functional  understanding 
of  spoken/written  Swedish.  The  reasons  for  choosing  par-
ticipants  between  18  and  30  years  of  age  was  that  the 
experiences  from  school  and  adolescence  would  potentially 
still  be  relatively  fresh  in  their  minds.  Also,  being  in  the 
middle  of  the  life  phase  of  interest,  it  is  difficult  to  discuss 
what  would  be  helpful  or  needed  in  the  future,  and  easier

when  looking  back. 

All  included  participants  self-identified  as  a  person 
with  covert  stuttering.  Background  information  including 
age  of  onset  of  stuttering,  therapy  history,  participation  in 
self-help  activities,  and  current  occupation  was  collected 
orally  prior  to  the  interview.  For  all  participants,  the  onset 
of  stuttering  had  occurred  in  early  childhood.  One  partici-
pant  reported  no  history  of  stuttering  therapy,  one  only 
having  had  an  assessment  by  an  SLP  and  a  few  follow-up 
sessions  to  follow  the  development  of  stuttering.  Three 
participants  had  received  therapy  in  adulthood,  and  the 
remaining  six  participants  participated 
in  therapy  from 
time  to  time  over  the  years  since  childhood.  Four  partici-
pants  were  in  therapy  at  the  time  of  the  study.  No  specific 
information  about  the  nature  of  the  prior  or  present  ther-
apy  was  gathered.  Six  participants  reported  past  or  cur-
rent  membership  in  the  National  Stuttering  Association 
(Stamningsförbundet);  four  participants  were  members  of 
for  PWS,  “Project  Talk”

Assessment  of  Social  Anxiety 

The  LSAS-SR  (Liebowitz,  1987)  is  a  scale  consisting 
of  24  items  that  assess  levels  of  fear  and  avoidance  in  24 
situations  that  are  likely  to  elicit  social  anxiety.  Thirteen 
of  the 
interaction  (e.g., 
hosting  a  party,  meeting  strangers),  and  11  items  inquire 

items  assess  situations  of  social 

about  performance  situations  (e.g.,  drinking  together  with 
others  in  public  places,  working  while  others  watch).  The 
response  format  is  a  4-point  Likert  scale  that  provides  an 
overall  score  for  the  scale  itself  as  well  as  for  subscales 
Fear  and  Avoidance  (Fresco  et  al.,  2001).  Cutoff  points 
for  circumscribed  social  phobia  and  for  generalized  social 
phobia  are  30  and  60,  respectively 
(Rytwinski  et  al., 
2009).  LSAS-SR 
is  a  reliable  measure  of  social  phobia 
with  high  internal  consistency  (Cronbach’s  α =  .95)  as  well 
as  high  discriminant  and  convergent  validity  (Heimberg 
et  al.,  1999).  The  scale  is  translated  into  Swedish  and  free 
to  use  (for  information,  see  https://www.fbanken.se/form/

The  total  score  of  social  anxiety  for  the  11  partici-

consent  form,  protocol  of  the  OASES,  and  the  LSAS-SR 
scale  were  sent  by  mail  to  the  participant,  together  with  a 
stamped  envelope  to  facilitate  a  return  of  all  documents  to 
the  principal  investigator.  To  allow  for  the  principal  inves-
tigator  to  check  that  the  protocols  had  been  adequately 
completed,  the  protocols  were  sent  out  well  in  advance  (2– 
3  weeks)  and  returned  before  the  interview  took  place. 

The  interviews  were  intended  to  be  performed  face-
to-face  in  a  venue  that  was  convenient  for  the  respondent, 
but  due  to  travel  restrictions  during  the  COVID-19  pan-
demic  imposed  when  six  of  the  interviews  had  been  com-
pleted,  the  remaining  interviews  had  to  be  conducted  via 
Zoom  Video  Communications.  All  participants 
inter-
viewed  via  this  system  were  informed  that  this  was  the 
tool  being  used  (for  which  complete  data  security  cannot 
be  guaranteed),  and  gave  their  consent.

Semistructured  interviews  were  used  to  learn  about 
the  underlying  factors  that  motivated  the  participants  in 
this  study  to  conceal  their  stuttering 
in  ways  that  they 
appeared  as  fluent  speakers  and  how  these  strategies  had 
first 
developed.  The 
author  using  an  interview  guide  with  topics  based  on  the 
research  aims, 
including  perception  of  stuttering,  speech 
and  communication,  reasons  for  covering  stuttering,  strat-
egies  to  cover  efficiently,  and  consequences  on  different 
aspects  of  life  as  a  result  of  the  use  of  strategies.  The  ques-
tions  in  the  interview  guide  were  designed  to  be  “neutral” 
in  the  sense  that  they  did  not  make  a  link  between  stutter-
ing  and  females,  specifically,  either  explicitly  or  implicitly. 
However,  in  the  closing  phase  of  the  interview,  the  partici-
pants  were  given  an  opportunity  to  reflect  on  their  experi-
ences  of  stuttering  from  a  female  perspective,  as  inspired

that  were  asked  to  all  participants,  follow-up  questions 
developed  dynamically,  which  allowed  for  each  conversa-
the 
tion 
opportunity  to  decide  for  themselves  what  the  questions 
meant,  and  the  interviewer  steered  them  back  only  when 
they  moved  on  to  themes  that  were  not  relevant  to  the 
purpose  of  the  study,  which  only  happened  in  rare  cases. 
Follow-up  questions  such  as  “ . . .could  you  elaborate  more 
on . . ., ” “. . .give  examples  of . . .,”  and  “ . . .tell  me  more 
about . . .”  were  used.  See  the  Appendix  for  the  interview

opportunity  to  make  comments  as  to  whether  opinions 
and  points  of  view  had  been  accurately  represented  and 

thus  validate  that  the  interviewer  did  not  misinterpret  any 
information.  The  interviewer  also  asked  each  participant 
to  give  feedback  on  the  questions,  whether  they  were  com-
prehensive  enough  or  whether  there  was  anything  further 
they  felt  they  wanted  to  add.

views  that  took  place  in  situ  were  digitally  recorded  with 
a  Canon  Legria  HFR806  camcorder.  The  recordings  of 
the  interviews  that  were  conducted  via  Zoom  Video  Com-
munications  were  made  using  the  software  recording  func-
tionalities.  To  ensure  sufficient  sound  quality,  the  inter-
views  were  audio-recorded,  using  a  Tascam  DR-22WL. 

Data  Analysis 

The  interviews  were  analyzed  using  qualitative  con-
tent  analysis.  The  intent  was  to  detect  emergence  of  cer-
tain  words,  themes,  or  concepts  within  qualitative  data, 
and  to  portray  and  understand  the  underlying  meaning  of 
the  participants’  perceptions  and  experiences.  The  purpose 
was  also  to  capture  descriptions  of  a  phenomenon  that  the 
interviewees  had 
in  common  (Hsieh  &  Shannon,  2005; 
Lindgren  et  al.,  2020).  Thus,  calculations  of  the  frequency 
of  different  responses  or  comparisons  of  frequencies  within 
or  between  themes  and  subthemes  were  not  included  in 
the  analysis. 

The  interviews  were  transcribed  verbatim  by  the  first 
author.  Revisions,  filler  words,  and  thought  abandonment 
were  documented  in  order  that  nuances  are  not  lost.  The 
occurrence  of  stuttered  moments  was  not  noted  since  it  was 
not  in  focus  of  the  research  question.  Pauses,  laughter,  and 
crying  were  also  included  in  the  transcriptions,  since  they 
gave  rich  information  to  the  underlying  meaning  of  what  is 
being  expressed  (Graneheim  &  Lundman,  2004).

Authors  1,  2,  and  4  participated  in  the  data  analysis. 
The  authors  first  read  the  transcripts  to  familiarize  them 
with  the  text.  Notes  were  taken,  individually,  of  essential 
sections 
followed  by  a  discussion 
between  the  authors  to  ensure  the  understanding  of  the 
essence  of  the  narratives.  The  next  step  to  follow  was  the 
decontextualization,  which  means

individual  interviews  are  separated  from  their  context  in 
order  to  elucidate  all  participants’  experiences  of  the  phe-
nomenon  under  study  (Friberg  et  al.,  2000).  The  decon-
textualization  process  is  thus  carried  out  by  breaking  out 
the  original  text  into  smaller  pieces:  meaning  units.  The 
meaning  units  are  then  condensed  and  coded  (Graneheim 
et  al.,  2017).

included  (Graneheim  &  Lundman,  2004).  When  meaning 
units  were  extracted  from  30%  of  the  interviews  (specifi-
cally  selected  for  their  richness  of  information),  the  first

After  this  step  the  recontextualization  phase  followed. 
This  phase  involves  combining  the  separated  utterances  into 
new  patterns  and  returning  them  to  their  context,  thus 
enabling  a  deeper  understanding  of  the  field  of 
interest 
(Friberg  et  al.,  2000).  The  codes  were  sorted  according  to 
similarities  and  differences  and  abstracted  into  subthemes 
and  final  themes.  In  order  to  achieve  credibility 
in  the 
judgment  of  similarities  within  and  differences  between 
the  categories,  this  part  of  the  analysis  was  done  by  con-
sensus  between 
(Graneheim  &  Lundman,

in  the  recontextualization  process

Results 

Overall,  participants  were  overwhelmingly  unani-
mous  in  their  perceptions  and  experiences.  We  have  been 
careful  to  capture  and  disclose  conflicting  perspectives  to 
the  extent  that  they  were  identified  in  the  data. 

Three  overarching  and  nine  subordinate 

thematic 
patterns  that  describe  common  elements  in  the  women’s 
accounts  of  their  experience  of  stuttering  were  extracted 
(see  Table  2).  The  following  sections  give  an  overview  of 
specific  themes  and  subthemes.  The  subthemes  are  illus-
trated  by  quotes,  selected  to  give  a  representation  of  state-
ments  that  were  expressed  by  the  participants  within  spe-
cific  themes  or  subthemes.  These  have  been  translated 
from  the  original  Swedish. 

In  addition  to  obtaining  the  participants’  accounts

their  experiences  of 

of 

information  was  also  collected  on  the  approximate  age  at 
which  participants  had  begun  to  cover  their  stuttering  in  a 
more  conscious  and  systematic  manner.  For  all  but  two 
participants,  this  occurred  during  adolescence,  with  varia-
tion  between  participants 
in  which  part  of  adolescence 
(early  or  late).  Two  participants  stated  that  they  had  con-
sciously  started  covering  their  stuttering  prior  to  adoles-
cence,  as  they  began  to  realize  that  verbal  activity  was 
required  in  respect  to  certain  achievements  at  school.  P3, 
for  example,  described  the  shift  from  stuttering  openly  to 
it:  “it  was  when  I  started  school,  when  I  was 
covering 
seven  or  eight  years  old,  when  I  started  to  understand  that 
we  would  start  to  give  brief  statements  or  say  your  name 
or  read  aloud  or  something,  so  I  think  it  was  then,  like, 
when  I  started  school.”

moments.  The  most  prominent  reason  was  to  avoid  embar-

was  a  way  of  avoiding  being  hurt,  a  way  of  protecting 
themselves.  It  helped  them  elude  the  fear  of  being  met  with 
negative  judgments  and  escape  the  risk  of  being  excluded. 
Their  stories  revealed  that  a  feeling  of  shame  was  a  pre-
dominant  reason  to  cover  stuttering,  a  desire  to  “be  nor-
mal.”  Stuttering  was  described  as  something  “sounding 
ugly”  and  speech  fluency  being  the  ideal.

P1:  I’m  super  scared  of  what  people  will  think  of 
me.  A  lot.  That  they’ll,  like,  think  I’m  weird,  not 
clever  or  unintelligent,  nervous,  um,  yeah,  some  sort 
of  freak.  I  just  want  people  to  think  I’m  normal.

Subtheme:  Coping  Strategies 

Participants 

talked  about  what  actions 

they  had 
taken  and  behaviors  that  had  been  altered  or  controlled  to 
pass  as  fluent.  Their  comments  were  expressions  of  minor 
changes,  such  as  changing  words  and  talking  less,  to  more 
extensive  changes  such  as  constantly  engaging  in  strategic 
thinking  and  changing  personality.  Furthermore,  partici-
pants  described  that  the  avoidance  behaviors  had  gradually 
come  to  encompass  all  situations  and  had  been  applied  with 
all  people,  partners,  and  family  members  included. 

P7:  Large  parts  of  my  life  are  adapted  to  my  stutter-
ing.  The  strategies  that  I  have  are  like  . . .  everything 
that  is  part  of  the  stuttering  package  is  often  used  to 
guide  my  decisions.  “Should  I  go  into  this  shop  or 
that  shop?  Where  are  the  nicest  people  on  staff?”  or 
“Which  coffee  should  I  choose?  I’d  rather  have  cap-
puccino,  but  I  won’t  get  that  word  out,”  so  I  go  for 
something  else.  Just  that  I  think  about 
it  almost 
constantly  and  choose  paths,  make  different  choices 
based  on  the  stuttering.  It’s  like  I’m  having  extra 
thoughts  in  my  brain  about  everything  all  the  time. 
I  don’t  make 
Maybe 
the  best  decisions  either 
because  I  choose  to  stutter  less. 

P8:  My  brain  starts  making  up  strategies  for  what-
ever  it  might  be.  It’s  something  that  goes  on  all  the 
time,  it  is  part  of  my  thinking.  I’m  trying  to,  like, 
come  up  with  strategies  for  a  seminar  which  will 
take  place  in  two  weeks. 

Some  participants  expressed  that  they  felt  that  SLPs 
and  the  school  had  been  instrumental  in  the  choice  of  cop-
ing  strategy  by  giving  permission  not  to  carry  out  certain 
activities,  thereby  signaling  support  that  there  was  indeed 
a  need  for  covering  the  stutter. 

Subtheme:  Insights 

Participants  discussed  insights  they  had  gained  about 
the  disadvantages  of  systematically  covering  stuttering  for 
many  years.  The  participants  defined  insights  as  “hiding  is 
a  betrayal  of  yourself  and  only  a  short-term  solution,”  or 
quite  simply  “Hiding  has  been  a  bad  strategy,  it  has  not 
helped.  Don’t  try  to  control  stuttering.”  Meeting  with 
others  who  stutter  had  been  crucial  for  the  participants  in 
getting  insights  and  new  perspectives  on  the  situation.  For 
increased  understanding  of  the  disorder  that  had 
some, 
been  gained  in  self-help  groups  or,  for  some,  in  stuttering 
therapy,  had  helped  reduce  self-blame  and  guilt.  The  fol-
lowing  quotations  convey  the  participants’  reflections  on 
the  usefulness  of  covering  as  a  coping  strategy: 

P1:  No,  but  what’s  not  good  [with  hiding]  is  that  the 
pressure  to  hide  it  increases  all  the  time.  The  more  I 
hide  it,  the  greater  the  shock  when  a  word  comes 
out  on  which  I  stutter  a  bit.  And  that  leads  to  an 
even  greater  anxiety  that  I  . . .  am  perceived  as  differ-
ent.  Really.  It’ s really  . . .  it’s  really  a  negative  spiral. 

P3:  In  the  short  term,  yes,  perhaps,  [it  is  useful  to 
cover  stuttering]  to  avoid  the  anxiety 
immediately 
when  it  happens.  Because  the  anxiety  is  enormous, 
there’s  like  heart  palpitations  and  sweating  and  you 
feel  like  shit,  so  you  want  to  avoid  that.  But  in  the 
long  term  no,  because  I  feel  so  limited  by  the  stutter-
ing.  The  stuttering  controls  my  life,  it’s  not  me  who 
controls  what  I  should  say  or  what  I  should  do  or 
whether  I  should  be  heard  or  whether  I  should  present 
something  or  say  my  name  or  what  I  want  to  eat  or 
who  I  need  to  call.  So  no,  it  hasn’t  been  a  good  idea. 

P10:  I’ve  realized  how  one’s  brain  really  can  take  con-
trol  completely.  How  fragile  you  are  mentally.  I  think 
I’ve  also  gained  a  tremendous  awareness  of  how  the 
brain  and  thoughts  can  work  and  how  unsynchro-
nized  one  can  be  intellectually  and  emotionally.  Intel-
lectually  I  know  I  won’t  die  if  I  stutter,  probably  no 
one  will  laugh  at  me  and  stuff,  but  emotionally  I 
think  I  will  die.  That  dissonance  is  incredible. 

P8:  When  I  was  in  middle  and  elementary  school,  I 
was  allowed  to  cover  my  stuttering.  I  was  allowed 
to  read  aloud,  but  if  I  asked,  I  didn’t  have  to.  And 
in  secondary  school  it  was  obvious,  I  was  allowed  to 
skip  the  oral  parts,  I  didn’t  have  to  do  it  at  all. 

P9:  I  only  went  to  an  SLP  once  to  get  a  certificate 
that  I  stuttered  so  I  wouldn’t  have  to  do  certain  oral

anxiety  could  be  induced  by  stuttering.  Fear,  action  paral-
ysis,  constant  worry,  and  powerlessness  were  other  emo-
tions  repeatedly  expressed. 

P2:  I’m  very  ashamed  of  my  stuttering.  So  emotion-
ally,  there  are  feelings  of  shame  that  arise  but  also  a 
lot  of  fear.  It’s  just  embarrassing  not  to  be  able  to 
say  your  name.  Being  able  to  introduce  yourself  by 
your  name  should  come  as  natural  as  going  to  the 
bathroom  by  yourself.  Any  adult  can  do  that.  And

say  your  name, 

P3:  [My  stuttering]  is  extremely  severe.  It  makes  me 
feel  terribly  bad  . . .  I  have  a  lot  of  underlying  anxiety 
about  it  . . .  it  is  the  only  thing  circulating  in  my  head. 

P10:  I  had  a  period  in  the  fall  of  2018  when  it  was 
like  an  obsession,  oh,  I  thought  about  my  stuttering 
all  the  time.  It  was  a  constant  worry  about  how  I 
was  going  to  manage  my  life  if  I  stuttered?  It  wasn’t 
that  I  wanted  to  end  my  life  but  it  was  just  so  diffi-
. . . .   I  was 
just  catastrophizing,  all  the  time,

. . .  well  I  was  walking  around 
which  made  me  feel 
. . .   cortisol 
constantly  with 
is  the  stress  hormone, 
isn’t  it?  in  the  body.  It  was  really  agonizing. 

P3  expressed  that  she  wished  that  she  had  had  a  stut-

tering  behavior  that  would  not  have  been  possible  to  hide: 

P3:  I  think  it  is  more  difficult  for  those  who  cover 
their  stuttering  than  for  those  who  can’t  hide  it.  The 
person  with  open  stuttering  might  disagree,  but 
it 
takes  so  much  more  energy  and  planning  for  the 
people  who  cover  their  stuttering  . . . .  I’d  rather  have 
open  stuttering.  And  just  stutter  openly  and  ignore 
it,  as  many  hopefully  do.  Because 
it  affects  self-
esteem  so  damn  much. 

One  participant  (P11)  expressed  irritation  and  a  frus-
trating  feeling  of  helplessness  rather  than  shame.  More 
than  anything,  however,  she  did  not  want  to  stutter,  which 
led  to  a  feeling  of  great  anger  about  the  situation. 

Subtheme:  Perceptions  of  Self 

Collectively,  perceptions  of  self  were  predominantly 
negative  due  to  the  experiences  of  stuttering,  with  stutter-
ing  associated  with  having  prevented  the  persons  from 
developing  a  “true  self.”  Frequent  comments  expressed  by 
the  women  were  that  they  felt  abnormal,  strange,  not  like 
everyone  else,  as  an  “alien.”  They  experienced  they  had  to 
go  to  great  lengths  to  appear  normal,  and  the  price  they 

had  to  pay  was  a  loss  of  self-esteem.  They  also  spoke  of 
how  they  felt  they  performed  less  well  because  of  the  stut-
tering,  which  in  turn  made  them  a  less  valuable  person. 
Stuttering  was  described  as  becoming  such  an  integral  part 
of  the  self  that  it  had  almost  taken  over  or  invaded  their 
personality. 

P6:  For  me,  the  brain  says  one  thing  and  the  heart 
says  another.  My  brain  says  the  stuttering  hasn’t 
affected  my  self-image,  but  my  heart  says 
defect.  That’s  what  my  heart  says  and  that’s  how  I 
see  myself. 

it’ s a  

P3:  Yes,  but  I  put  so  much  value  in  the  fact  that 
stuttering  “is”  me  and  that  it  defines  me  as  a  person 
and  that  I  think  people  have  preconceived  notions 
about  what  a  person  who  stutters  is  like.  And  it’s 
very  important  for  me  to  appear  a  certain  way,  I 
. . .   no,  so  it  has  affected  my  self-image 
guess  and 
tremendously. 

The  participants,  however,  did  not  only  speak 

in 
negative  terms  of  their  experiences  of  stuttering,  but  they 
also  expressed  that  stuttering  had  had  some  positive  impact 
on  the  perception  of  self  and  development  of  self-esteem. 
They  mentioned  that  mastering  stuttering  had  given  them 
strength  and  a  stronger  belief  in  their  own  abilities  (“ I can  
get  through  with  more  than  I  think”).  Some  described  how 
experience  of  living  with  stuttering  had  also  made  them  a 
“better”  person,  in  the  sense  that  they  had  become  more 
empathetic  and  responsive  to  others. 

P2:  I  learned  to  be  very  empathetic  to  others  who 
may  have  other  difficulties  as  well.  That  not  every-
. . .  well,  no  one  is  perfect.  That  we  all  have 
one  is 
something  to  deal  with. 

Subtheme:  Impact  on  Personal  Development 

The 

impact  of  stuttering  on  personal  development 
was  discussed  by  the  participants.  They  talked  about  how 
stuttering  had  generated  a  high  level  of  anxiety  about  the 
future  and  had  influenced  all  their  decisions:  from  career 
choice,  field  of  study,  whether  to  study  abroad,  to  partici-
pation  in  everyday  activities. 

P4:  My  stuttering  has  had  an  impact  on  what  and 
where  I  chose  to  study,  the  social  contexts  I  chose 
to  be  part  of,  the  job  I  have  now.  I  mean,  I  can’t 
even  call  the  doctor  myself  or  make  a  phone  call  if 
there’s  something

Subtheme:  Female  Perspective 

Participants  reflected  on  how  being  a  woman  might 
have  impacted  their  experiences.  The  participants  com-
monly  spoke  about  there  being  an  expectation  on  women 
to  be  perfect  and  not  take  up  space,  while  men  are  more 
readily  accepted  the  way  they  are.  Participants  discussed 
women’s  self-image  as  distinct  from  men’s,  and  women 
being  more  concerned 
into  societal 
norms.  They  also  mentioned  that  due  to  the  common 
understanding  of  stuttering  being  a  disorder  that  mainly 
affects  men,  some  felt  very  alone  as  a  woman  who  stut-
ters.  More  knowledge  about  women  and  stuttering  and 
women’s  perspectives  on  stuttering  was  called  for  by  sev-
eral  respondents.

P6:  It’s  often  said  that  more  guys  have  persistent 
stuttering.  But  I’ve  been  thinking  that  . . .  well,  yeah, 
sure,  it  could  be.  But  I  also  think  there’s  a  lot  that’s 
missed  in  girls.  Like,  people  haven’t  heard  me  stut-
ter,  I  know  for  sure  because  I  talk  with  fluency  quite 
often,  or  very  often.  So,  I  believe  there  are  a  lot  of 
girls  who  actually  have  done  that  too  and  still  do.  I 
know  of  other  people  who  stutter  in  a  similar  way 
as  I  do  and  they’re  all  girls.  And  many  of  them  feel 
this  shame,  once  a  stuttered  moment  is  obvious,  that 
they’re  like,  “Oh,  what  am  I  going  to  do  now?” 

though 

P7:  I  grew  up  with  mostly  experiences  of  guys  stut-
tering  and  I  think  it’s  really  important  to  raise  the 
perspective  of  women.  Even 
statistically 
there  seems  to  be  more  guys  in  the  world  who  stut-
ter,  I  think  there  are  a  lot  of  girls  who  walk  around 
with  covert  stuttering.  Stuttering  doesn’t  fit  in  with 
. . .  well,  girls  should 
the  image  of  how  it  should  be 
be  good,  perfect,  not  be  annoying,  not 
take  up 
space,  that  they  sort  of  hide  the  stutter.  That’s  what 
I’ve  been  doing.  Then  if  it’s  just  because  I’m  a  girl 
that  I’ve  done  so,  I  don’t  know,  I  might  have  done 
the  same  thing  if  I  was  a  guy,  but  I  think  it’s  really 
important  that  you  make  comparisons  between  guys 
and  girls.  What  the  similarities  and  differences  are, 
linked  to  our  gender. 

P8:  I  think  as  women  we’re  kind  of  not  supposed  to 
make  our  voices  heard.  It’s  not  so  long  ago  that  we 
were  not  allowed  to  vote  and  . . .  and  it’s  very  much

Theme:  Stuttering  as  a  Phenomenon 

Subtheme:  Beliefs  About  How  Others  View 
Stuttering 

Participants  perceived  people  around 

them  as 
uncomprehending  and  uninformed  about  stuttering,  and 
that  stuttering  seems  to  be  an  area  of  taboo.  Participants 
talked  about  feeling  pitied  by  people  or  that  people  per-
ceived  them  as  shy  or  nervous,  which  fueled  the  internal 
requirement  to  present  an  uncracked  facade.  At  the  same 
time,  they  acknowledged  that  it  was  their  own  percep-
tions  of  what  they  believed  that  people  thought  about 
stuttering,  and  that  they  could  not  be  sure  if  it  was  really 
true,  especially  as  most  reactions 
listeners  were 
actually  not  that  strong. 

from 

P3:  I’ve  come  across  people  who  don’t  really  under-
stand  what  it  is,  and  they  may  have  made  a  face  or 
laughed  or  mocked  and  so  on  and  it  hurts  a  great 
deal  and  you  get  really  sad  and  angry  and  feel 
extremely  ashamed  which  makes  you  not  want  to 
. . .  well,  be  in  a  situation  like  that  again  so  then  you 
. . .  well,  so  that  you  don’t 
avoid  even  more  so  that 
stutter  in  front  of  someone.  But,  for  the  most  part, 
people  are  nice.  They  are.  It’s  mostly  me  who’s 
mean  to  myself.  I  judge  myself  more  than  they  [lis-
teners]  judge  me,  probably.  I  think  so,  anyway.  No, 
but  I  know  that.  I  know  that. 

P11:  It  feels  like  people  get  so  uncomfortable  when 
you  stand  there  and  kind  of  have  a  block  and  then 
just  stands  there  and  waits,  or  I  don’t 
everyone 
know.  I  guess  that  says  more  about  me  than  it  does 
about  them,  that  I  think  that  way,  but  it  just  feels 
like  people  get  so  uncomfortable  and  then  I  get 
uncomfortable  because  they  get  uncomfortable. 

P10’s  impression  was  that  others  did  not  really  care 
that  much  at  all.  In  her  view,  this  had  both  a  positive  and 
negative  side: 

P10:  It’s  nice  because  then  you  know  that  no,  at 
least  they  [others]  don’t  think  it’s  annoying  or  that 
it’s  weird.  But  I’d  wished  they  would  care  and  ask 
more  questions,  because  I  might  want  to  talk  more 
it.  Because  there’s  a 
about 
lot  you  can  bring  up 
about  it,  there’s  a  lot  to  tell.

For  some  of  the  participants,  stuttering  had  been  per-
ceived  as  an  incomprehensible  phenomenon  for  most  of 
their  childhood.  P10  stated:  “I  thought  that  the  blockings 
in  my  speech  was  just  me  having  a  mental  disorder,  like, 
that  something  was  wrong  with  me.”  Others  described  that 
stuttering  often  occurred  in  articulatorily  demanding  words 
implied  a  constant,  highly 
(consonant  clusters),  which 
energy-consuming,  internal  processing  of  words  and  sen-
tences.  P5  did  not  understand  the  nature  of  stuttering  until 
her  teens,  when  she  first  came  to  stuttering  therapy: 

P5:  Around  15,  16,  I  started  seeing  an  SLP.  And 
then  things  turned  around  a  bit,  for  a  while.  It  was 
partly  because  I  got  help  explaining  what  it  [stutter-
ing]  was all  about.  I didn’t  even  know  what  it  was. 
And then  also I felt  that  I wasn’t  . . .  that  it  made  me 
feel  that  . . .  okay,  it’s  not  me  being  mentally  retarded. 

The  description  of  stuttering  behavior  varied  slightly 
between  participants,  but  most  reported  tension  during 
speech  as  the  essential  experience,  and  blockings  being  the 
most  feared  stuttering  behavior.  The  physical  and  mental 
impact 
the  participants  was 
described  in  terms  of  fatigue  and  loss  of  energy.  Current 
state,  conversation  partner,  and  speaking  activity 
influ-
enced  moments  of  stuttering. 

stuttering  had  on

P3:  Well  physically  I  would  say  that  there  is  tension 
in  the  throat  and  muscles.  If  I’m  a  bit  more 
. . .   if 
I’m  quite  calm  when  I  talk,  my  stuttering  blocks  are 
not  as  hard.  But  when  I’m  in  situations  with  people 
I  don’t  know  and  so  on,  then  I  can  sort  of  push  the 
words  out.  I  don’t  know  if  I  make  any  faces,  I  prob-
ably  make  some  hand  movements,  and  I  don’t  have 
a  lot  of  eye  contact  when  I  talk,  in  case  I  stutter.  I 
kind  of  look  away.  It’s  also  different  depending  on 
whom  I’m  talking  to.

. . .   filled  with  struggle 
P4: 
both  physically  and  mentally,  and  there’s  a  lot  of 
tension  that  I  have  in  my  jaws  and  often  migraines, 
so  there’s  a  lot  of  those  kind  of  things.  But  also 
. . .  
it  depends  quite  a  lot  on  what  mood  I’m  in  I  would 
say.  For  example,  if  I  have  a  cold  or  I’m  sick  or  I 
haven’t  slept  well,  it  immediately  gets  a  lot  worse. 

The  Essence  of  the  Narratives 

On  the  basis  of  the  above  findings,  the  essence  of  the 
women’s  experience  of  stuttering  can  be  subsumed  as  follows: 

A  picture  emerged  of  persons  who  basically  enjoy 
they 

talking,  and  socializing;  something 

communicating, 

consider  themselves  good  at.  Several  of  the  participants 
explicitly  described 
large 
vocabulary,  and  good  at  expressing  themselves.  What  they 
all  shared,  however,  was  that  they  had  allowed  their  stutter-
ing  “to  get  the  better  of  them.” 

themselves  as  verbal,  with  a 

to 

the  women,  was 

Stuttering  was  depicted  as  if  it  were  an  entity  of  its 
own;  an  autonomous,  negative  force  that  controlled  and 
restricted  their  lives.  A  very  distressing  aspect  of  stuttering, 
according 
its  unpredictability.  The 
unpredictability  was  managed  by  being  constantly  on  guard 
for  the  possibility  that  stuttering  might  occur  and  by  behav-
ing  in  a  reserved  or  withdrawn  manner  in  communicative 
contexts.  The  mental  effort  involved  in  maintaining  a  with-
drawn  mode  of  communication  was  described  as  significant. 
On  a  physical  level,  speech  and  communication  were  also 
perceived  as  strenuous  and  enormously  energy-consuming. 

All  women  testified  that  their  self-image  had  been 
negatively  affected  by  their  stuttering.  The  feeling  conveyed 
in  their  narratives  was  that  self-image  had  been  distorted  or 
damaged  by  their  stuttering  because  stuttering  equated  to 
being  defective,  abnormal,  or  a  bad  person.  However,  some-
times  stuttering  could  have  a  positive  impact  on  self-image. 
It  could  bring  a  sudden  sense  of  empowerment  and  confi-
dence,  a  feeling  of  being  a  person  who  dares. 

The  reason  all  women  shared  for  covering  their  stut-
tering  was  that  stuttering 
is  embarrassing  and  shameful, 
and  with  it  comes  a  fear  of  disapproval  from  people  around. 
To  avoid  the  shame  of  being  caught  stuttering,  the  dysfluen-
cies  must  be  suppressed  at  all  costs.  Stuttering  was  seen  as 
something  with  bad  connotations,  a  behavior  surrounded  by 
taboo  and  silence. 

The  lack  of  information  about  women  who  stutter  and 
representation  of  females  who  stutter 
in  the  public  arena 
had  had  a  strong  negative  impact.  Without  other  women  as 
role  models  or  stories  from  others  to  reflect  in,  a  feeling  of 
being  alone,  unique,  or  abnormal,  was  created.  Hence,  stut-
tering  was  a  predicament  very  difficult  to  accept.  Partici-
pants  reflected  on  their  choice  to  cover  stuttering:  Being  a 
woman  means  being  at  a  disadvantage,  because  women  gen-
erally  find  it  harder  than  men  to  be  accepted  as  they  are 
and  therefore  care  more  than  men  about  how  they  appear. 
Being  a  woman  who  stutters  is  to  be  at  an  even  greater  dis-
advantage  as  you  risk  appearing  even  weaker  and  more 
insecure.  Consequently,  there  are  strong  incentives  not  to  let 
stuttering  be  seen  or  heard. 

Discussion 

The  purpose  of  this  study  was  to  broaden  the  cur-
rent  knowledge  of  covert  stuttering  in  women  and  explore 
underlying  factors  that  motivate  women  who  stutter  to

were  typically  fluent  speakers.  The  participants’  descrip-
tions  were  in  many  ways  consistent  with  those  of  previous 
studies  of  covert  stuttering.  For  example,  their  experiences 
of  a  stereotype  societal  view  of  what  characterizes  a  person 
who  stutters  had  led  them  to  use  a  variety  of  strategies  to 
be  viewed  as  typically  fluent  speakers,  in  order  to  achieve 
the  same  privileges  and  to  maintain  what  they  considered 
prestigious  in  a  “normal”  social  profile  (Constantino  et  al., 
2017;  Douglass  &  Tetnowski,  2015).  However,  by  focusing 
specifically  on  female  PWS,  the  findings  of  this  study 
deepen  and  extend  knowledge  on  the  phenomenon,  as  nor-

mative  expectations  of  women  and  men

academically.  The  impact  of  stuttering  on  areas  such  as 
finances  (income)  and  physical  health  also  appeared  in  the 
narratives.  Stuttering  had 
largely  been  reported  to  have 
had  a  strong  negative  impact  on  development  of  identity, 
such  as  self-image.  Shame  was  a  recurring  concept  and 
came  to  permeate  the  women’s  stories.  Shame  was  also 
the  emotion  that  emerged  as  most  crucial  for  the  choice  of 
coping  strategy,  that  is,  covering  the  stuttering.

Pulcu  et  al.  (2013)  argue  that  shame  should  be  seen 
as  one  of  several  self-blaming  moral  emotions.  The  results 
of  our  study  are  thus 
line  with  the  findings  of,  for 
example,  Paganini  et  al.  (2022).  In  their  study,  the  impact 
of  gender  on  coping  strategies  in  individuals  with  cleft  lip 
and  palate  was  examined.  They  found  that  coping  with

women  were  more 
in  self-blame  while 
denial  was  the  emotion  more  prevalent  among  men.  In 
the  general  population,  shame  and  guilt  are  self-conscious 
emotions  that  are  more  prevalent  in  women  than  in  men 
(Else-Quest  et  al.,  2012).  Thus, 
feelings  of  shame 
expressed  by  the  women  in  our  data  could  be  explained  or 
understood  as  a  “gendered”  emotion,  if,  following  Nang 
et  al.  (2018),  we  assume  that  gender  expression  (here:  fem-

levels  of  stress  and  anxiety  (Matos  et  al.,  2013),  and  in 
our  data,  there  were  recurring  examples  of  how  stuttering 
induced  high  levels  of  anxiety.  High  levels  of  anxiety  were 
also  reflected  in  the  results  of  the  LSAS-SR.

guilt,  and  embarrassment  are  defined  as  self-conscious

sidering  the  stereotypical  beliefs  about  stuttering  that  exist 
in  many  societies  (St.  Louis  &  Tellis,  2015)  and  the  result-

greatest  extent  possible.  These  findings  are  relevant  to  the 
women  in  this  study  as  expressed  in  their  strong  wish  of 
“being  normal.”  The  way  in  which  the  women  chose  to 
manage  their  desire  to  be  normal  ties  in  with  the  discus-
in  the  work  of  Watermeyer  and  Kathard  (2016).

They  discuss  how  PWS, 
communication 
involves  both  speaking  fluently  and  with  a  stutter,  may 
lead  to  a  complex  view  of  disability  identity—one  is  both 
able  and  disabled.  The  authors  suggest  that  this  dichot-
omy  encourages  psychologically  demanding  efforts 
to 
become  “nondisabled”  (Watermeyer  &  Kathard,  2016). 
The  women  in  this  study  were  concerned  with  what  others 
would  think  if  their  stuttering  were  obvious  and  hosted  a 
fear  of  being  misjudged 
terms  of  personality  and

for  whom 

their  stuttering  are 

To  manage  their  stuttering,  the  women  engaged  in 
coping  strategies  that  consisted  of  avoiding  sounds,  words, 
people,  and  situations,  or  to  talk 
less.  These  avoidance 
behaviors  are  common 
in  PWS.  Briley  and  Kalinowski 
(2016)  hypothesize  that  all  PWS  have  developed  an  inher-
ent  hierarchy  of  how  to  conceal  the  stuttered  moments. 
They  suggest  that  some  PWS  are  able  to  communicate 
well  with  the  help  of  strict  internal  measures  of  conceal-
ment,  while  others  are  unable  to  avoid  disclosure  of  stut-
tering.  Those  most  likely  to  succeed  in  their  intention  to 
conceal 
those  with  mild  stuttering 
(Briley  &  Kalinowski,  2016).  The  degree  of  complexity  of 
stuttering  behavior  is  found  to  correlate  weakly  with  men-
tal  health  status,  anxiety,  or  depression  (O’Brian  et  al., 
2022).  Thus,  there  is  little  reason  to  expect  that  a  person 
with  complex  stuttering  behavior  would  be  more  likely  to 
experience  severe  psychological  distress  than  a  person  with 
the  participating 
less  complex  stuttering  behavior.  For

Considering  how  the  women  described  their  manifest  stut-
tering  behavior,  it  appears  to  have  been  mild.  The  relative 
mildness  of 
features  was  experienced  as 
being  “both  a  blessing  and  a  curse.”  On  the  one  hand, 
having  a  mild  stutter  was  a  relief,  because  it  was  possible 
to  cover  efficiently.  On  the  other  hand,  it  was  a  burden— 
if  the  stuttering  behavior  had  been  severe  enough,  the  cov-

it 
would  have  been  easier  to  accept  being  a  PWS.  Reflecting

a  majority  of  the  women  expressed  that  the  strategy  “had 
taken  more  than  it  had  provided.”  In  the  short  term,  it 
had  provided  an  immediate  relief  of  anxiety  but,  in  the 
long  term,  it  had  led  to  severe  limitations  and  had  a  nega-
tive  impact  on  different  areas  of  life:  “The  stuttering  con-
trols  my  life,  it’s  not  me  who  controls  what  I  say  or  what 
I do”  (P4).  If  anything,  the  use  of  avoidance  behavior  had 
worsened  their  overall  view  of  stuttering  since  it  was  con-
stantly  on  their  minds.  This  finding  is  in  line  with  Perkins 
(1990)  who  stated  that  “ . . .in  my  experience,  those  who 
have  complained  most  bitterly  and  seemed  most  fearful  of 
stuttering  are  clients  whom  I  have  rarely,  or  ever,  heard 
stutter.  To  say  they  do  not  stutter  is  to  deny  that  they 
consider  themselves  stutterers”  (p.  375). 

It  may  be  that  a  combination  of  mild  stuttering  and 
gender  norms  are  two  interacting  factors  influencing  the 
choice  of  strategy.  Results  from  research  on  girls  and  boys 
with  autism  have  shown 
that  girls  show  significantly 
higher  levels  in  adaptive  ability  than  boys  and  are  more 
prone  to  use  different  camouflaging  behaviors  and  strate-
gies  in  order  to  hide  their  autistic  symptoms  (Bernardin 
et  al.,  2021;  Myles  et  al.,  2019;  Wood-Downie  et  al., 
2020).  An  explanation  of  the  sex  difference,  offered  by 
Corscadden  and  Casserly  (2021),  is  that  extrinsic  autistic 
features  often  appear  more  subtly  in  girls,  making  it  easier 
for  girls  to  conceal  their  symptoms,  so  that  they  succeed 
in  their  ambition  to  “go  under  the  radar.”  Moreover,  girls 
than  boys,  show  an 
with  autism, 
increased  willingness  and  motivation 
in 
to  participate 
social  contexts  (Corscadden  &  Casserly,  2021).  This  differ-
ence  between  the  sexes 
is 
reported  also  to  exist  in  females  and  males  in  the  general 
population  (Rose  &  Rudolph,  2006).  There  is  no  reason 
to  believe  that  this  would  not  be  true  for  women  who  stut-
ter, 
into 
leading  to  the  assumption  that  a  desire  to  fit 
social  contexts  would  make  female  PWS  extra  motivated 
to  hide  the  fact  that  they  stutter  by  covering  the  stuttering 
behavior.

The  results  of  the  data  raise  questions  about  the  lack 
of  external  support  as  experienced  by  a  number  of  the 
women,  and  how  they  felt  they  were  left  alone  with  their 
predicament.  Some  of  the  women  described  sporadic  or 
nonexistent  support,  both  from  school  educators  and  from

important  others,  such  as  school  staff  and  SLPs,  had  sig-
naled  that  their  avoidance  behavior  was  appropriate  by 
sanctioning  the  women’s  efforts  not  to  allow  the  stuttering 
to  manifest.  Moreover,  the  lack  of  adequate  support  may 
further  have  reinforced  the  women’s  perception  of  being 
alone  as  a  woman  who  stutters,  and  made  their  assump-
tion  that  stuttering  is  a  disorder  that  mainly  affects  men 
even  more  entrenched.  This  is  an  important  finding  that

ceived  as  a  rewarding  challenge  (Douglass  et  al.,  2018). 

According  to  Douglass  et  al.  (2018),  two  more  fac-
tors,  besides  SLP  intervention,  are  of  major  importance 
for  people  with  covert  stuttering  in  their  transferring  to 
stutter  openly:  meeting  with  others  and  hitting  a  psycho-
logical  low  point.  Both  factors  were  present  in  our  data. 
The  women  in  our  study  had  not  yet  transitioned  from 
covert  to  overt  stuttering,  but  when  asked  to  reflect  on  the 
benefits  of  the  coping  strategy  they  had  chosen,  their  indi-
vidual  responses  were  unanimous  in  that  it  had  not  been 
worth  all  the  effort  it  had  required.  For  several,  this  reali-

Experiencing  loneliness  can  prevent  acceptance  of  the  dis-

both  validating  and  reassuring.  It  also  tends  to  remove

come  primarily 

Also,  the  experience  of  having  reached  rock  bottom, 
psychologically,  emerged  in  several  of  the  women’s  narra-
tives.  P1  described  her  view:  “Try  to  be  as  open  as  you 
can  and  don’t  dig  yourself  into  some  deep  hole.  Get  help, 
‘Do  you  have  contact  with  an  SLP?’ ‘No. ’ ‘Do  it!  Contact 
a  psychologist  while  you’re  at  it.  Get  to  grips  with  it  right 
away!’  It’s  really  important  that  you  know  that  it’s  noth-
ing  strange  [to  stutter].  It’s  not  worth  hiding  it.” 

Limitations  and  Future  Directions 

One  strength  of  this  study 

large 
is  the  relatively 
number  of  women  who  wanted  to  participate  as 
infor-
mants  despite  a  rather  narrow  inclusion  criterion  in  terms 
of  age.  However,  this  strength  can  also  be  perceived  as  a 
limitation  of  the  study,  as  demographically  the  partici-
pants  came  to  form  a 
largely  homogeneous  group,  not 
only  in  terms  of  age  and  sex,  but  also  with  striking  simi-
larities  socially,  educationally,  and  ethnically.  Sex  and  age 
are  undoubtedly  factors  of 
importance  for  how  people 
perceive,  experience,  and  cope  with  a  health  condition, 
but  so  are  socio-economic  standing,  cultural  background, 
and  ethnicity.  In  this  study,  the  women  were  remarkably 
their  experiences  and  descriptions,  which 
consistent 
in 
may  be  explained  by 
their  demographic  homogeneity. 
These  results  may  not  express  insights  from  a  woman  with 
a  different  ethnical  or  cultural  background.  It  may  be  that 
future  studies  will  help  to 
integrate  other 
demographic  aspects  that  may  explain,  or  have  an  impact 
on,  how  and  why  covert  stuttering  emerges  and  develops.

“When  asked  why  it  is  attractive  to  speak  more  fluently, 
Serenity  answered,  To  be  like  everybody  else.  I  know  we 
shouldn’t  try  to  be  like  everybody  else,  we  should  try  to

that’s  a  difference.  Being  a

woman,  that’s  a  difference.  And  stuttering  on  top  of  that? 
And  then  over-weight  on  top  of  that?  No,  that,  all  of  that, 
it’s  too  many”  (p.  35). 

Clearly,  it  is  not  unique  for  women  to  harbor  strong 
negative  emotions  such  as  shame  and  guilt  toward  various 
kinds  of  disorders  or  dysfunctions;  gender  norms  also 
apply  to  males.  Interviews  with  men  have  shown  that 
there  is  a  taboo  on  seeking  help  for  emotional  distress  and 
that  it  is  at  odds  with  being  successful  and  independent 
(Möller-Leimkühler,  2002).  In  line  with  how  the  women 
in  this  study  wished  to  conceal  their  stuttering  in  order  to 
pass  as  fluent,  research  has  shown  that  men  (in  general, 
not  specifically  men  who  stutter)  have  a  fear  that  others’ 
image  of  them  will  change  if  their  difficulties  and  prob-
lems  are  revealed,  and  a  fear  of  being  judged  as  inade-
quate  or  weak  (Addis  &  Mahalik,  2003;  Tyler  &  Williams, 
2014).  Further  research  on  men’s  incentives  to  use  avoid-
ance  behaviors  as  a  coping  strategy  for  stuttering  may 
therefore  be  valuable. 

In  addition,  and  as  mentioned  earlier,  there  are  sev-
eral  further  contextual  variables  that  can  uniquely  influ-
ence  a  speaker’s  perception  of  their  own  communication 
and  stuttering,  such  as  socioeconomic  circumstances  and 
cultural  and  ethnic  background.  Thus,  the  results  of  this 
study  may  reflect  conditions  specific  to  Sweden,  warrant-
ing  future  studies  with  similar  questions  from  a  variety  of 
settings  to  discern  the  extent  to  which  contextual  variables 
have  an  impact  on  the  results. 

A  further  limitation  of  the  study  was  the  difference 
in  interviewing  procedures  between  participants  (face-to-
face  and  digital  interviews),  an  unavoidable  fact  due  to 
the  pandemic.  However,  the 
interviewer  did  not  notice 
any  difference  in  quality  between  the  two  approaches,  in 
terms  of  the  way  contact  was  established  between  inter-
viewer  and  participant,  the  openness  of  participants 
in 
their  responses,  or  their  willingness  to  share  information. 

Clinical  Implications 

The  results  of  this  study  contribute  to  the  knowledge 
and  understanding  of  females  who  stutter  and  the  driving 
forces  that  underlie  the  desire  to  conceal  stuttering  in  an 
attempt  to  be  perceived  as  a  person  who  does  not  stutter. 
To  get  access  to  SLP  intervention,  meeting  with  others  with 
similar  experiences  and  hitting  a  psychological  low  point 
importance  for  achieving 
have  been  reported  to  be  of 

change  (Douglass  et  al.,  2018),  and  the  women’s  narratives 
are  in  line  with  these  findings.  This  further  supports  the  clin-
ical  implications  proposed  by  Douglass  et  al.  (2018):  SLPs 
with  knowledge  and  training  in  counselling  are  needed  to 
enable  best  possible  care  for  people  who  covertly  stutter, 
and  SLPs  should  facilitate  clients’  participation  in  group 
therapy  or  initiate  a  support  group  for  PWS  covertly. 

The  results  of  this  study  can  help  to  ensure  that  ade-
quate  support  and 
in  place  at  an 
interventions  are  put 
early  stage,  especially  for  girls  who  stutter,  to  prevent  neg-
ative  impact  on  quality  of  life,  mental  health  problems, 
in  different 
development  of  self-stigma,  and 
areas  of  daily  activities.  The  unique  experience  of  stutter-
ing  should  be  taken  into  account  in  order  to  increase  the 
value  and  efficacy  of  therapy  and  help  reduce  the  impact 
of  stuttering  on  a  person’s  life  (Tichenor  et  al.,  2022).

Interview  Guide  Used  for  Semistructured  In-Depth  Interviews 

Introduction  (refer  to  written  information) 

You  have  agreed  to  let  me  do  an  interview  with  you.  The  reason  I  am  doing  this  interview  is  to  find  out  more  about  what  is 
known  as  covert  stuttering,  that  is,  stuttering  that  a  listener  cannot  hear  but  often  requires  many  different  coping  strategies 
for  the  speaker.  I  am  interested  in  knowing  how  you  would  describe  your  speech  and  stuttering  and  what  experiences  you 
have  of  speaking,  your  experiences  of  communication,  what  emotions 
it  might  evoke.  I  will  record  this  interview  so  that  I 
can  go  back  to  what  you  have  said  afterwards. 

Clarify  any  issues  raised  in  previously  completed  protocols  (the  OASES,  LSAS-RS) 
First,  I  just  want  to  know  a  little  about  what  are  you  doing  right  now  (are  you  in  college/university,  working,  or  something 

else)? 

Have  you  been  in  stuttering  treatment? 
Have  you  attended  any  self-help  groups  (e.g.,  through  the  National  Stuttering  Association)?

How  would  you  describe  the  way  you  speak  and  communicate?

How  would  you  describe  your  stuttering?

When  you  think  about  your  stuttering,  your  speech  and  how  you  communicate - what  are  your  thoughts,  what 
emotions  come  up?

How  has  stuttering  affected  the  way  you  live  your  life?

How  do  people  react  to  your  stuttering?

Has  your  life  with  a  stutter  changed  over  time?

Is  there  a  particular  situation  when  stuttering  affected  you  negatively  (or  positively)  that  you  remember  clearly? 

Reasons  for  covering  stuttering

-

-

-

-

Can  you  tell  me  how  it  comes  that  you  cover  your  stuttering  in  different  situations?

Why  is  it  necessary  for  you  to  cover  your  stuttering?

Has  there  been  a  particular  situation  or  event  that  has  contributed  to  you  doing  this?

How  old  were  you  when  you  started  to  deliberately  cover  stuttering  in  social  situations?  Has  it  changed  over  time? 

Strategies  to  cover  efficiently

How  did  you  learn  to  cover  stuttering?

What  skills  do  you  need  to  cover  stuttering  successfully?

In  what  situations  do  you  cover  stuttering?

Can  you  tell  me  about  behaviors  and  thoughts  you  have  in  different  situations,  related  to  stuttering?

Based  on  these  thoughts  and  behaviors  you  have  described,  are  there  some  that  happen  automatically  and  intuitively 
and  some  that  require  more  effort?

Has  the  strategy  of  covering  stuttering  been  a  good  coping  strategy?

Do  you  find  that  your  mental  and  physical  energy  levels  are  affected  by  your  strategy?

Can  you  tell  me  about  any  time  or  situation  when  stuttering  has  influenced  decisions  you  have  made  in  your  life?

Does  stuttering  affect  how  you  think  about  the  future?
How  would  it  be  if  you  did  not  stutter—would  you  do  different  things,  or  would  your  life  be  different?

Do  you  think  that  stuttering  has  had  an  influence  on  your  self-image?  On  your  self-confidence?

Why  is  it  attractive  to  speak  with  fluency?

Has  stuttering  and  the  way  you  speak  and  communicate  contributed  to  how  you  identify  yourself  today?

A  female  perspective

-

I  am  interested  in  women’s  experiences  of  stuttering  because  very  little  is  known  about  it.  What  are  your  thoughts?

What  advice  would  you  give  to  another  woman  who  stutters?
