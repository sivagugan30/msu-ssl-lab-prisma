Speech  produced  by  typically  developing  adults  at  their  habitual  speech  rate  is  characterized  by  low 
utterance-to-utterance  variability.  Higher  production  variability  has  been  hypothesized  to  underlie  the 
occurrence of stutter-like disfluencies among individuals who stutter. Adults who stutter (AWS) have been 
found  to  have  higher  articulatory  variability  when  producing  sentences,  nonwords  and  even  single 
phonemes  relative  to  fluent  controls.  Prior  research  also  showed  that  movement  variability  has  the 
potential to differentiate children who will recover from stuttering and the ones who will persist. However, 
it’s  challenging  to  measure  articulatory  movement  since  it  requires  specialized  instruments.  Few  studies 
measured  variability  acoustically.  This  study  collects  acoustic  signals  remotely  and  explores  whether  a 
group  difference  would  also  emerge  in  acoustic  variability  in  producing  a  single  phoneme  /s/.  If  the 
measure  is  sensitive  enough,  the  method  can  be  adopted  more  widely.  Nine  AWS  and  Nine  matched 
control produced 180 instances of the target sound /s/ embedded within words and nonwords, which are 
further embedded in carrier phrases. The duration for /s/ was significantly influenced by phonetic contexts. 
However, the current study did not find the spectral variability of /s/ to be influenced by contexts nor did it 
differ by participant groups.

1. INTRODUCTION

Speech production requires highly skilled motor coordination. The articulatory movement of typically
developing  adults  is  characterized  by  low  utterance-to-utterance  variability  at their  habitual  speech rate 
(Smith et al., 1995). Compared to adults, children were often found to exhibit higher utterance variability 
when producing the same syllables or words for multiple times (Smith et al., 1992; Stathopoulos, 1995). 
The source of production variability is likely to be multifaceted in nonexperimental contexts, as changes in 
dialects or prosody could both increase repetition variability (Munson, 2019). When variability due to these 
stylistic  choices  were  minimized  in  a  controlled  experimental  setting,  production  variability  is  often 
attributed  to  the  presence of  neural  noise that  disturbs  the  transmission  of  motor  commands for  speech 
production (Stathopoulos, 1995). In this sense, articulatory variability is a sign of motor immaturity. 

Adults who stutter (AWS) exhibited higher variability in lip aperture (Smith et al., 2010), movements 
of the tongue body and velum (Wiltshire et al., 2021) relative to the controls in producing multisyllabic 
nonwords,  even  when  their  speech  were  perceptually  fluent.  High  production  variability  may  also 
differentiate the speech of children who may eventually persist to stutter relative to children who’s stuttering 
eventually recover. Usler et al (2017) observed that children who persisted to stutter in school year exhibited 
higher production variability when they were in preschools, relative to both children who recovered and 
children who did not stutter. The articulatory movement of AWS was also more disturbed by an increase 
in phonological complexity when producing nonwords (Smith et al., 2010) and syntactic complexity when 
producing sentences (Kleinow & Smith, 2001). The findings were interpreted to suggest that the speech 
production system of AWS is unstable, and its occasional breakdowns result in perceivable disfluencies 
(Smith et al., 2010).  

If  the  hypothesis  were  to  be  interpreted  in  a  strong  causal  sense  (Wiltshire  et  al.,  2021),  higher 
variability should be observed among individuals who stutter at all linguistic units. Frisch et al (2016) found 
that  AWS  exhibited  greater  tongue  movement  variability  when  producing  the  voiceless  velar  stop  /k/ 
relative to fluent controls. However, most prior studies on the motor variability of AWS investigated speech 
units  that  were  at  least  at  the  syllable  level.  Besides,  more  studies  are  needed  for  us  to  know  whether 
acoustic measures can also reliably capture the difference in production variability among AWS relative to 
controls (Howell et al., 2009). Munson (2001, 2004) found the trajectory for the spectral means for /s/ was 
influenced by the coordination between the articulators. /s/ was found to be more variable before /p/ than 
before /t/ because the articulatory movements involved for lip rounding for /p/ is more variable than /t/. 
Consistent with previous studies, children were found to have higher acoustic variability relative to adults 
over  repeated  production  of  phoneme  /s/.  The  current  study  attempts  to  further  explore  the  speech 
movement  variability  of  individuals  who  stutter  by  comparing  the  acoustic  variability  of  /s/  between 
matched pairs of AWS and fluent controls.  

2. METHODOLOGY
A. PARTICIPANTS

Participants were eighteen adults who do (n = 9, Mean age = 30.7 years, age range = 23-42 years, SD
= 6.18, n = 8 males, n = 1 females) and do not stutter (n = 9, Mean age = 30.6, age range = 21 – 42 years, 
SD = 6.39, n = 8 males, n = 1 females). Participants in the two groups were matched on age (± 2 years), 
gender, and education level (± 2 years). To be included in the study, participants met the following criteria: 
a) monolingual native speakers of American English; b) no history of speech-language disorder(s) besides
stuttering, c) no history of neurological, reading, or intellectual difficulty. Adults who stutter were recruited
through Facebook groups, referrals, and from a contact list of previous participants who indicated interest

for other studies. Adults who do not stutter were recruited through the website Research Match. The study 
protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the university. 

B. STIMULI

The target sound /s/ was embedded in 3 sV syllables and 6 sCV syllables (Table 1). The vowel was
either /a/, /i/, or /u/, while the consonant was either /t/ or /p/. The 9 syllables were embedded in both words 
and  nonwords,  which  gave  rise  to  18  tokens.  The  words  and  nonwords  tokens  were  selected  to  be 
comparable in phonotactic probabilities, F (1,16) = 0.01, p = 0.91 (Vitevitch et al., 2004). The 18 tokens 
each occurred once in syntactically simple and complex carrier sentences. The carrier sentences were the 
same for words and nonwords. The 36 sentences were each repeated 5 times, for a total of 180 instances 
for the target sound /s/. Production prompts were prerecorded by a phonetically trained male adult speaker 
of American English. The prompted were recorded with a sampling rate at 44.1 kHz and 16-bit quantization. 
The intensity was normalized to 68 dB in Praat.

C. DATA COLLECTION

Data collection took place remotely in participants’ own rooms. Participants were asked to reduce noise
in their environment by closing the doors and windows. Assessing that the potential participants have access 
to  a  quiet  and  private  space  was  part  of  the  recruitment  and  screening  process.  Participants  were  also 
screened to have a pair of eligible headphones to record audio at a sampling rate of 22.1 kHz. During data 
collection, the participants were asked to repeat a sentence again if there was audible noise, inaccuracies, 
or disfluencies on the target sound /s/. The recording was done using a GUI embedded in Qualtrics run on 
participants’ consumer computer. Both the experimenter and participant devices were connected to wi-fi, 
not using cellular data. The GUI digitized the audio stream in Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC), so that 
the audios were compressed for data transmission purposes, but the compression did not result in any loss 
in  quality.  The  audio files were saved  to  a virtual machine  hosted  on a  server owned  by the  university 
dedicated to handle sensitive data. The researchers accessed the audio files through Box. 1 AWS and 7 
control  participants  had  1  to  2  missing  data  due  to  technical  glitches  in  saving  the  files.  More  control 
participants experienced technical glitches, because they were recruited after the Qualtrics website reported 
an intermittent issue with saving data.

D. ANALYSIS

The Praat was used for acoustic analyses (Boersma & Weenink, 2002). The onsets and offsets of /s/
was labeled by the Montreal Forced Aligner (McAuliffe et al., 2017). The boundaries for every target sound 
/s/ was checked and corrected by the author. The beginning of /s/ was marked at the beginning of aperiodic 
high-frequency noise. This was indicated by both clear increase in frication noise in the waveform and by 
the presence of white noise in a frequency band above 1000 Hz on the spectrogram. When the target sound 
/s/ is followed by a vowel, the off sets were marked at the first glottal pulse of the vowel. When the target 
sound /s/ is followed by a stop sound, the off sets were marked at the end of high-frequency aperiodic noise 
observed on both the waveform and the spectrogram. 

Praat automatically measured the duration and spectral means for the target sound /s/. The duration for 
/s/ ranged from 10 ms to 427 ms with a mean of 128 ms (SD = 65.8). The index of variability in duration 
was  the  coefficient  of  variance  (the  standard  deviation  divided  by  the  mean)  (Munson,  2004).  Spectral 
variability was calculated by taking into consideration the changes over the course of the fricatives (Munson, 
2004). Spectral means were calculated over the 500 to 7500 Hz spectral range. The original continuous 
signals of the spectral means were resampled to 7 points by taking 7 nonoverlapping segments (Smith et 
al., 2000). Each segment spans 10 ms. /s/ segments that were shorter than 70 ms were removed from the 
analysis on spectral variability. Less than 5% of the trials were removed. The spectral means were calculated 
for  the  500-7500  Hz  frequency  range.  The  spectral  variability  was  indexed  by  the  sum  of  7  standard 
deviations over 5 repetitions (Smith et al., 2000) (Figure 1). 

Figure 1: (a) Spectral means for 10 ms windows of the fricative /s/ in 5 repetitions of the word /supər/ 
and nonword /subɑrb/ produced by an adult who do not stutter. The gold line connects the spectral mean 
for each time windows over five repetitions; (b) The standard deviation computed over the 5 repetitions. 
The spectral variability is indexed by summed standard deviations over 7-time windows.

3. RESULTS

Three dependent variables were analyzed separately with a four-factor mixed effect ANOVA model.
In  each  ANOVA  model,  group  was  the  between-subject  factor  (AWS,  AWNS),  vowel  (/i/,  /a/,  /u/), 
consonant  context  (/sV/,  /spV/,  /stV/),  and  lexicality  (word,  nonword)  were  the  within-subject  factors. 
Preliminary analysis suggested that syntactic complexity did not influence any of the dependent variable, 
so it was not included in any of the further analyses. The alpha level was set at 0.01 for evaluating the main 
effects and interactions. Multiple comparisons were adjusted with Bonferroni correction. Effect sizes (ES) 
were indexed with standardized beta coefficients. 

A. VARIABILITY IN DURATION

The first analysis investigated intra-talker variability in utterance duration for /s/. A significant main
effect of vowel was found, F (2,32) = 4.67, p = 0.0098. The duration for /s/ was significantly more variable 
before /a/ (M = 0.16, SD = 0.11) relative to before /i/ (M = 0.14, SD = 0.09), ES = 0.25. A significant main 
effect  of  the  consonant  context  was  also  found,  F  (2,32)  =  11.15,  p  <0.001.  The  duration  for  /s/  was 
significant more variable before /t/ (M = 0.17, SD = 0.11) than both /p/ (M = 0.14, SD = 0.09), ES = 0.27, 
and null (M = 0.13, SD = 0.10), ES = 0.38, which did not differ from each other. The interaction between 
vowel and the consonant context was also statistically significant, F (4, 64) = 9.05, p < 0.001. The effect 
suggest that the durational variability for /s/ did not differ between consonant contexts (stV, spV, sV) when 
the vowel was /u/. When the vowel was /i/, the duration for /s/ was significantly more variable both in 
bilabial (spV), ES = 0.61, and alveolar (stV), ES = 0.52, contexts relative to the null context (sV). When 
the vowel was /a/, the duration for /s/ was significantly more variable in the alveolar context (stV) relative 
to the bilabial (spV), ES = 0.66, and the null (sV), ES = 0.73, contexts (figure 2). 

Figure 2. Durational variability for /s/ in different phonetic contexts. Note. NoN stands for the context 
for /s/ followed immediately by a vowel “sV.” Note. Variability is calculated with coefficient of variation 

Other than that, in sV contexts, /s/ was more variable in duration before /u/ than before /i/, ES = 0.60. 
In stV contexts, /s/ was more variable in duration before /a/ than before both /i/, ES = 0.57, and /u/, ES = 
0.59. The difference between AWS (M = 0.16, SD = 0.11) and the controls (M = 0.13, SD = 0.08) was not 
statistically significant, F (1, 16) = 1.92, ES = 0.31. All the other main effects and interactions were not 
statistically significant.

B. SPECTRAL VARIABILITY

Figure 3. Spectral variability for /s/ in different phonetic contexts. Note. NoN stands for the context for 
/s/ followed immediately by a vowel “sV.” 

The second analysis investigated intra-talker variability in spectral means when producing /s/. None of 
the main effects nor interactions were significant at the 0.01 level (figure 3). The main effect of vowel was 
significant at a relaxed alpha level (0.03), F (2,32) = 3.96, p = 0.0195. The spectral variability of /s/ was 
larger before /i/ (M = 2.29, SD = 0.97) than before /u/ (M = 2.11, SD = 0.79), ES = 0.20, p = 0.005. However, 
the  effect  was  not  significant  after  Bonferroni  correction  (p  =  0.016).  The  difference  can  be  mainly 
attributed to the difference between /i/ (M = 2.35, SD = 0.80) and /u/ (M = 2.02, SD = 0.83) in the bilabial 
consonant context (spi vs spu), ES = 0.35. The difference between AWS (M = 2.14, SD = 0.76) and the 
controls (M = 2.26, SD = 1.01) was not statistically significant, F (1, 16) = 0.66, ES = 0.13.

C. DURATION

The  third  analysis  investigated  the  duration  for  /s/  in  different  phonetic  context.  /s/  was  significant
longer in nonwords (M = 116 ms, SD = 25 ms) than in words (M = 108 ms, SD = 23 ms), F (1, 16) = 38.2, 
p <0.001, ES = 0.31. The main effect of vowel, F (2,32) = 32.98, p < 0.001, and consonant context were 
statistically significant, F (2,32) = 32.98, p < 0.001. The interaction between vowel and consonant context 
was also statistically significant, F (4, 64) = 30.1, p < 0.001. The interaction suggested that /s/ did not differ 
in duration by consonant contexts if the vowel was /u/. When the vowel was /i/, /s/ was significantly longer 
in “si” tokens (M = 136 ms, SD = 13 ms) than “sti” tokens (M = 104 ms, SD = 20 ms) and “spi” tokens (M 
= 111 ms, SD = 21 ms), which did not differ from each other. When the vowel was /a/, all the contrasts 
regarding consonant contexts were statistically significant: sa (M = 119 ms, SD = 29 ms), sta (M = 86 ms, 
SD = 23 ms), spa (M = 111 ms,  SD = 19 ms) (figure 5). The main effect  of group was not statistically 
significant, and none of the interactions involving group was significant.

immediately by a vowel “sV.”  

4. LIMITATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS

The current study was conducted remotely during the COVID pandemic (2020 - present). Therefore,
the environment for the data collection was not ideal. At the beginning of each data collection session, the 
first  author  confirmed  that  the  participants’  headphone  can  record  at  a  sampling  rate  of  22.1  kHz  and 
checked the audio settings on participants’ computers. However, there could still be a lot of unknown factors 
that can influence the audio recordings relating to each participants’ headphones and computer settings. 
These unknown differences between participants also added noise to the data and made it easier to commit 
a type II error. Besides, for some participants, their audio recordings miss spectral information above 7500 
Hz due to unknown technical difficulties relating to remote data collection. Since the spectral region up to 
8.7 kHz was important for /s/, the missing information could have contributed to the null finding for spectral 
variability in different phonetic contexts.  

Nevertheless,  the  study  demonstrated  that  the  phonetic  contexts  exerted  a  significant  influence  on 
duration variability of /s/ among both adults who do and do not stutter. /s/ was least variable when followed 
directly by a vowel relative to followed by either /t/ or /p/. It could be that the articulatory movement is 
more complex for producing consonant clusters such as /st/ and /sp/, so there is greater variability in the 
duration for producing /s/ in those phonetic contexts. The effect applied to both adults who do and do not 
stutter. However, current evidence was inconsistent with the hypothesis that phonetic contexts influence

spectral  variability  since  none  of  the  factors  reached  statistical  significance.  Current  evidence  was  also 
inconsistent  that  adults  who  stutter  exhibited  greater  production  variability  when  producing  the  single 
phoneme /s/ relative to fluent adults. 

Future studies with larger sample size and more controlled experimentation environment are needed to 
further investigate whether adults who do and do not stutter exhibit greater variability in producing single 
phonemes (Wiltshire et al., 2021). If evidence were mixed on speech movement variability between groups 
on single phonemes, the original hypothesis may need to be qualified.   

5. CONCLUSIONS

The current study is inconclusive regarding the effect of phonetic contexts on the spectral variability
for /s/ and whether AWS exhibited greater variability. Future studies with more controlled experimental 
settings are needed for a better understanding of the topic.
