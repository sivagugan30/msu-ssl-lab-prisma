Purpose:  The  primary  purpose  of 
to  evaluate  correlations 
(SWL),  self-acceptance 
between  stuttering  severity  and  satisfaction  with 
(SA),  self-compassion 
(PWS) 
and  did  seek  support  or  did  not  seek  support  from  family,  friends,  and  the 
National  Stuttering  Association  (NSA). 
Method:  This  study  surveyed  47  self-identified  PWS  from  a  larger  study  in  order 
to  obtain  information  on  background,  avoidance,  SA,  SWL,  and  SC.  Correlation 
analyses  were  used  to  examine  concurrent  associations. 
Results:  Stuttering  severity  was  significantly  correlated  with 
lower  SA  and 
higher  avoidance  among  PWS  who  did  not  seek  support  from  friends.  Stuttering 
severity  was  not  significantly  correlated  with 
lower  SC,  or  higher 
avoidance  among  PWS  who  sought  support  from  friends  or  family.  However, 
correlations  between  stuttering  severity  and 
lower  SWL  were  similarly  strong 
and  significant  among  PWS  who  did  and  did  not  seek  support  from  friends  and 
from  family.  Stuttering  severity  was  significantly  correlated  with 
lower  SA  and 
lower  SWL  among  PWS  who  sought  support  from  the  NSA,  but  not  correlated 
with  these  variables  among  PWS  who  did  not  seek  support  from  the  NSA. 
Conclusions:  Correlations  between  greater  stuttering  severity  and 
lowered 
SWL,  SA,  SC,  and  increased  avoidance  were  not  reduced  with  presence  of  for-
mal  support 
in 
some  cases.  Additional  research  is  needed  to  address  why  a  person  is  more  or 
less  likely  to  seek  support  and  the  impact  support  has  on  the  life  of  the  person.

Stuttering  and  the  life  experiences  that  can  accom-
pany  stuttering  often  serve  as  a  stressor  in  the  life  of  a 
person  who  stutters.  Coping,  in  general,  can  be  viewed  as 
an  attempt  to  deal  with,  adjust  to,  adapt  to,  or  overcome 
a  stressor.  Any  effort  to  manage  a  stressor,  like  stuttering, 
could  be  considered  a  coping  response.  Certain  ways  of 
coping  with  stuttering  may  be  more  effective  or  beneficial

has  on  the  lives  of  many  PWS,  particularly  as  it  relates  to

quality  of  life  can  be  greatly  affected  by  the  experience  of 
stuttering  (Craig  et  al.,  2009;  Gunn  et  al.,  2014;  Iverach 
et  al.,  2009,  2010;  Plexico  et  al.,  2019).  Quality  of  life  is  a 
complex  construct.  Conceptually,  we  assess  quality  of  life 
to  ascertain  the  degree  to  which  there  is  a  gap  between 
one’s  perceived  reality  and  personal  aspirations.  Clinically, 
it  is  used  as  a  functional  and  helpful  indicator  of  how  a

research  surrounding  the  broader  impacts  of  stuttering  has 
focused  on  quality  of  life  (Boyle  et  al.,  2018;  Carter  et  al., 
2017;  Craig  et  al.,  2009;  Koedoot  et  al.,  2011;  Nang  et  al., 
2018;  Yaruss,  2010).  Given  that  quality  of  life  and  self-
esteem  are  complex  and  multidimensional  constructs, 
decoupling  what  factors  contribute  to  an  overall  high  or 
low  quality  of  life  with  PWS  is  important.  Some  factors 
that  could  influence  quality  of  life  include  satisfaction  with

that  have  an

For  many  adults  who  stutter,  stuttering  has  become 
long-term  and  perceivably  uncontrollable  and  rela-
a 
tively  unpredictable  stressor 
(Cooper,  1968;  Manning, 
2001;  Perkins,  1990).  Avoidant  strategies  often  prevail 
when  an  individual  feels  as  if  he  or  she  has  no  control 
over  a  given  stressor  (Carver  et  al.,  1993;  Lazarus  & 
Folkman,  1984).  Responses  that 
type  of 
distraction,  withdrawal,  or  emotional  discharge  would  be 
categorized  as  avoidant  forms  of  coping.  Using  avoidant 
types  of  coping  strategies  to  manage  stuttering  has  been 
documented  as  having  a  negative 
impact  on  outcomes 
(Plexico  et  al.,  2009b;  Starkweather,  1987;  Van  Riper,

1973).  Researchers  have 
strategies  work  best  for  short-term  stressors  and  are  less 
successful  with  long-term  stressors  like  stuttering.  Avoid-
ance  is  less  effective  for  long-term  or  persistent  stressors 
because  the  problem  is  not  being  solved  and  is  likely  to 
reemerge.  Responses 
type  of  direct 
action,  cognitive  coping,  and  the  seeking  of  social  sup-
port  are  categorized  as  approach  forms  of  coping  (Wills 
&  Hirky,  1996)  and  have  been  found  to  be  more  effec-

Finally,  a  situational  factor  to  be  considered  is  the 
amount  of  social  support  a  person  who  stutters  has  avail-
able  to  them  and  the  overall  influence  that  has  on  SWL, 
SA,  and  SC.  Brissette  et  al.  (2002)  hypothesized  that  an 
individual’s  well-being  could  be  influenced  by  the  size  of 
his  or  her  social  network.  In  essence,  they  thought  that 
social  networks  could  act  as  a  stress  buffer.  They  sug-

less  distressed 
than  individuals  who  do  not  have  social  networks  (Boyle, 
2013;  Hogan,  2017).  However, 
it  should  be  noted  that 
social  support  may  not  always  serve  as  a  buffer  because 
social  support  may  not  always  be  perceived  as  helpful. 
The  degree  to  which  the  support  is  perceived  as  helpful 
depends  on  how  effectively  the  person  seeking  support  can 
receive  that  support  and  the  effectiveness  of  the  person 
providing  the  support.

Social  support  is  an  important  aspect  of  an  individ-
ual’s  experience  as  they  process  the 
life 
experiences  with  the  help  of  others  around  them.  Support 
can  be  provided  through  a  multitude  of  avenues.  Formal 
support  can  be  accessed  through  trained  professionals  and 
established  organizations.  Many  formal  self-help  support

for  PWS  often 
report  that  attendance  is  beneficial  (Boyle,  2013;  Reeves

Tetnowski  (2011)  conducted  a  qualitative  investigation  on

Purpose  of  This  Study 

The  impact  support  has  on  the  life  of  a  person  who 
stutters  and  the  cognitive  and  affective  manifestations  of 
stuttering  are  currently  not  well  understood.  It  is  recog-
nized  that  there  is  not  always  a  linear  relationship  between 
stuttering  severity  and  the  cognitive  and  affective  manifes-
tations  of  stuttering.  The  literature  indicates  that  stuttering 
increases  a  PWS’s  susceptibility  to  stress 
as  a  stressor 
and  a  diminished  SWL,  lower  SA,  and  increased  avoid-
ance  (De  Nil  &  Brutten,  1991;  Eggers  et  al.,  2010;  Plexico 
et  al.,  2009a,  2009b,  2019;  Tran  et  al.,  2011).  We  also 
know  that  people  who  self-report  greater  stuttering  sever-
ity  are  also  more  likely  to  report  a  decreased  SWL  and 
(Boyle,  2015;  Koedoot 
increased  avoidance  behavior 
et  al.,  2011).  One  way  PWS  cope  with  a  diminished  SWL, 
SA,  SC,  and  increased  avoidance  is  to  seek  support.  How-
ever,  the  degree  to  which  support  serves  as  an  effective 
coping  response  for  PWS  by  increasing  SWL,  increasing 
SA  and  SC,  as  well  as  decreasing  avoidance  behavior, 
remains  unclear. 

Therefore,  the  primary  purpose  of  this  study  was  to 
evaluate  whether  correlations  between  stuttering  severity 
and  SWL,  SA,  SC,  and  avoidance  differ  between  PWS 
and  seek  support  compared  to  PWS  and  do  not  seek  sup-
port.  Interest  in  support  centers  around  the  idea  that  cer-
tain  types  of  support  may  be  more  effective  or  beneficial 
than  others  in  terms  of  promoting  emotional  well-being, 
greater  satisfaction  with  life,  and  reducing  avoidance.  We 
hypothesized  that  associations  between  stuttering  severity 
and  diminished  SWL,  lower  SA,  lower  SC,  and  increased 
avoidance  would  be  attenuated  with  formal  support  (i.e., 
support  from  the  NSA)  and  remain  the  same  for  those 
who  seek  informal  support  (i.e.,  support  from  family  or 
friends).

The  participants 

included  47  self-
identified  PWS  from  a  larger  study.  Table  1  summarizes 
the  demographic  information  based  on  gender,  age,  and 
level  of  education.  Approximately  62%  of  the  participants 
were  male  and  34%  were  female.  Two  participants  (4%) 
chose  not  to  specify.  The  ages  of  the  participants  were  mea-
sured  in  age  ranges  with  the  majority  of  the  participants 
(43%)  being  between  19  and  24  years  of  age.  The  most  fre-
quently  recorded  answers  regarding  education  level  were 
4  years  of  college  (30%)  and  master’s  degree  (28%).  Twenty 
states,  as  well  as  the  District  of  Columbia,  were  represented 
in  the  participants.  However,  due  to  recruitment  methods, 
the  majority  of  participants  (54.8%)  were  from  Alabama. 
One  participant  resided  outside  of  the  United  States. 

The  participants  were  asked  to  rate  their  severity  of 
stuttering  on  a  scale  from  1  to  9.  On  this  scale,  1  was 
described  as  mild , 5 as  moderate,  and  9  as  severe.  Forty-
six  of  the  47  participants  provided  a  severity  rating.  The 
mean  stuttering  severity  was  3.91.  The  participants’  treat-
ment  history  was  also  queried.  The  majority  of  partici-
pants  (80.9%;  n  =  38) 
indicated  that  they  had  received 
treatment  or  are  currently  receiving  treatment  for  their

Cognitive  Behavioral  Avoidance  Scale

factors 

The  Cognitive  Behavioral  Avoidance  Scale  is  a  31-
item  multidimensional  scale  that  measures  cognitive  and 
behavioral  avoidance  (Ottenbreit  &  Dobson,  2004).  The 
participants  responded  to  items  using  a  scale  of  1  (not  at 
all  true  for  me ) to 5 (extremely  true  for  me).  This  scale 
measured 
reflect  a  combination  of 
cognitive/behavioral  and  social/nonsocial  dimensions  of 
avoidance.  The  four  factors  are  behavioral  social,  cogni-
tive  nonsocial,  cognitive  social,  and  behavioral  nonsocial 
avoidance.  Overall  scores  range  from  31  to  155,  with 
higher  scores  representing  greater  avoidance.  The  scale 
has  good 
internal  consistency,  test/retest  reliability,  and 
convergent  and  divergent  validity.

To  measure  SA,  a  36-item  Self-Acceptance  Scale 
was  administered  (Berger,  1952).  The  scale  uses  a  5-point 
Likert-type  scale  that  ranges  from  1  (Not  at  all  true  of 
myself ) to 5 (True  of  myself).  Higher  scores  on  the  mea-
sure  indicate  greater  SA  with  scores  ranging  from  36  to 
180.  Psychometrically,  the  scale  has  been  demonstrated  to 
have  matched-half  reliability  and  validity. 

Satisfaction  With  Life 

Diener  et  al.  (1985)  designed  The  Satisfaction  with 
Life  Scale  (SWL)  to  measure  global  life  satisfaction.  It  is 
a  5-item  scale  that  requires  participants  to  rate  items  on  a 
7-point  Likert-type  scale  that  ranges  from  1  (strongly  dis-
agree ) to 7 (strongly  agree).  Higher  scores  (i.e.,  31–35)  on 
the  scale  indicate  greater  SWL  with  scores  ranging  from  5 
to  35.  Scores  below  9  indicate  extreme  dissatisfaction  with 
life.  The  scale  has  good  psychometric  properties  with  good 
reliability  and  convergent  validity  (Diener  et  al.,  1985; 
Pavot  &  Diener,  1993). 

Self-Compassion  Scale 

To  measure  SC,  the  26  item  Self-Compassion  Scale 
(SCS;  Neff,  2003a)  was  administered.  This  self-report  mea-
sure  consists  of  six  subscales  to  assess  the  three  main 
dimensions  of  SC:  self-kindness,  common  humanity,  and 
mindfulness.  These  dimensions  are  paired  with  their  nega-
tive  counterparts:  self-judgment,  isolation,  and  over-identi-
fication.  Responses  are  rated  on  a  5-point  Likert  scale 
with  responses  ranging  from  1  (almost  never ) to 5 (almost 
always).  Following  reverse  coding  of  the  negative  dimen-
sions,  mean  scores  for  the  six  subscales  are  averaged  to 
find  the  overall  SC  scores.  Higher  scores  represent  greater 

SIG 4 Fluency and Fluency Disorders

SC.  Neff  (2003a)  reports  an  internal  consistency  reliability 
of  .92.  The  SCS  demonstrates  good  test–retest  reliability, 
concurrent  validity,  convergent  validity,  and  discriminant 
validity  (Neff,  2003a;  Neff  et  al.,  2007). 

Results 

Descriptive  analyses  showed 

that  seeking  support 
from  the  NSA  was  more  common  than  not  seeking  sup-
port  from  the  NSA  among  PWS.  Approximately  equal 
numbers  of  PWS  indicated  that  they  sought  support  or 
did  not  seek  support  from  family  and  from  friends.  A 
small  percentage  of  PWS  reported  that  they  sought  psy-
chological,  religious,  or  other  types  of  support.  Given  the 
low  rates  of  seeking  support  from  other  sources,  subse-
quent  analyses  were  restricted  to  seeking  support  from  the 
NSA,  family,  and  friends  (see  Figure  1). 

Next,  we  used  t  tests  to  compare  stuttering  severity 
between  PWS  who  sought  support  or  did  not  seek  support 
from  the  NSA,  family,  and  friends.  Stuttering  severity  did 
not  differ  between  PWS  who  sought  support  or  did  not 
seek  support 
friends.  However, 
PWS  who  sought  support  from  the  NSA  reported  more 
severe  stuttering  than  PWS  who  did  not  seek  support  from 
the  NSA,  t(40.60)  =  −3.49,  p  =  .001  (see  Table  2).

Next,  we  computed  correlations  between  stuttering 
severity  and  adjustment  variables  separately  for  PWS  who 
sought  support  or  did  not  seek  support  from  family,  from 
friends,  and  from  the  NSA  (see  Table  3).  Stuttering  sever-
ity  was  significantly  correlated  with  lower  SA  (r  =  −45; 
p  <  .05)  and  higher  avoidance  (r  =  .49;  p  <  .05)  among

between  stuttering  severity  and  SA,  SC,  and  avoidance 
were  not  significant  among  PWS  who  sought  support 
from  friends  or  from  family,  suggesting  that  support  from 
friends  may  serve  a  protective  function  against  lower  SA 
and  higher  avoidance  for  PWS  with  more  severe  stutter-
ing.  However,  correlations  between  stuttering  severity  and 
lower  satisfaction  with  life  were  similarly  strong  and  sig-
nificant  among  PWS  who  did  (r  =  .54;  p  <  .05)  and  did 
not  (r  =  .49;  p  <  05)  seek  support  from  friends  and  did 
(r  =  .75;  p  <  .001)  and  did  not  (r  =  .41;  p  <  .05)  seek  sup-
port  from  family,  suggesting  a 
limit  on  the  protective 
function  of  support  from  friends  and  family. 

In  partial  contrast,  stuttering  severity  was  not  corre-
lated  with  adjustment  variables  among  PWS  who  did  not 
seek  support  from  the  NSA,  whereas  stuttering  severity 
was  significantly  correlated  with  lower  SA  (r  =  .41;  p  < 
.05)  and  lower  satisfaction  with  life  (r  =  −.60;  p  <  .001)

Although  these  analyses  suggest  that  seeking  support  from 
the  NSA  may  not  serve  the  same  protective  function  as 
seeking  support  from  friends,  these  analyses  were  biased 
by  the  greater  severity  of  stuttering  among  PWS  who 
sought  support  from  the  NSA,  compared  to  PWS  who  did 
not  seek  support  from  the  NSA.

observed  between  stuttering  severity  and  SWL,  SA,  SC, 
and  avoidance  in  PWS.  Overall,  it  was  found  that,  for  this 
study’s  group  of  respondents,  seeking  support  from  the 
NSA  was  more  common  than  not,  and  those  who  sought 
support 
the  NSA  self-reported  greater  stuttering 
severity.  This  finding  is  consistent  with  Boyle  (2013)  who 
found  that  those  who  sought  support  also  self-reported 
greater  stuttering  severity.  It  was  hypothesized  that  corre-
lations  between  severity  and  lowered  SWL,  SA,  SC,  and 
increased  avoidance  would  be  lower  with  formal  support. 
The  findings  from  this  study  do  not  support  the  hypothe-
sis.  Of  those  who  sought  support  from  the  NSA,  severity 
was  negatively  correlated  with  SWL  and  SA.  Of  those 
who  did  not  seek  support  from  the  NSA,  severity  was  not 
correlated  with  SWL,  SA,  SC,  or  avoidance.  The  findings 
from  this  study  do  not  indicate  that  formal  support  is  not 
helpful;  the  results  do  indicate  that  individuals  who  are 
likely  to  seek  a  formal  support  group  are  more  likely  to 
self-report  a  more  severe  stuttering  severity.  Given  the

correlations  between  stuttering  severity  and  both  lower  SA

The  results  of  this  study  indicate  that  support  may 
be  beneficial  for  PWS,  particularly  in  regard  to  clinical 
relevance  and  outcomes.  There  are  different  types  of  sup-
port  available,  depending  on  the  specific  needs  and  desires 
individual.  The  results  suggest  that  people  with 
of  the 
greater  stuttering  severity  may  choose  more  formal  sup-
port  mechanisms.  For  best  practice,  it  is  strongly  advised 
that  clinicians  understand  the  different  types  of  support 
available  for  the  clients  who  stutter  and  make  recommen-
dations  for  securing  a  support  system  according  to  the  cli-
ent’s  preferences. 

The  literature  indicates  that  persons  are  most  likely 
to  seek  support  from  friends  and  families  first  and  then 
from  more  formal  sources 
last  (Goodwin  et  al.,  2016; 
Hinson  &  Swanson,  1993;  Pavuluri  et  al.,  1996).  While 
the  authors  did  not  request  information  from  the  partici-
pants  in  the  survey  about  the  order  in  which  they  received 
support,  friends  and  family  are  a  personal  resource  often 
relied  upon  until  a  perceived  need  for  formal  support  exists 
(Cohen,  1999).  It  can  be  beneficial  to  have  a  strong  net-
work  of  family  and  friends  that  can  be  trusted  during  times 
of  need.  Informal  supports  often  can  help  buffer  stress  and 
provide  information,  advice,  guidance,  or  distraction  during 
times  of  need  or  stress  (Boyle  et  al.,  2018;  Pearson,  1986). 
Supportive  relationships  with  family  and  friends  are  often 
valuable  when  you  need  someone  to  empathically  listen  to 
problem-based  fears  and  when  there  is  a  need  for  outside 
encouragement  and  emotional  support  when  feeling  stressed 
or  down.  Having  a  poor  network  of  social  support  can  lead 
to  feelings  of  depression  and  loneliness.  Informal  sources  of 
support  often  give  people  a  sense  of  belonging  and  can 
serve  as  a  protective  function.  While  each  person  has  some 
less 
personal  attributes  that  might  make  them  more  or 

SIG 4 Fluency and Fluency Disorders

likely  to  seek  support,  the  severity  of  the  problem  and 
working  relationship  with  other  professionals  could  also 
contribute  to  whether  an  individual  would  be  more  or  less 
likely  to  seek  help  outside  their  family  and  friend  network. 
Furthermore,  anticipated  self-stigma  can  also  cause  individ-
uals  to  shy  away  from  formal  support  and  choose  avoidant 
coping  strategies  (Holubova  et  al.,  2016;  Stier  &  Hinshaw, 
2007). 

There  are 

theoretical  models 

that  outline  help-
seeking  behavior  and  conditions  that  must  be 
in  place 
before  a  person  would  be  in  a  position  to  seek  formal  sup-
port.  One  model,  the  Keith-Lucas  model  (Cohen,  1999), 
indicates  that  four  conditions  need  to  be  met  for  an  indi-
vidual  to  seek  formal  support:  admit  need,  be  prepared  to 
self-disclose,  be  prepared  to  allow  someone  else  to  exert 
some  control  over  life  or  problem,  and  a  willingness  to 
change.  More  research  is  needed  to  evaluate  what  factors 
contribute  to  whether  a  person  is  more  or  less  likely  to 
seek  formal  support  and  the  impact  support  has  on  the  life 
of  the  person.  The  relationship  a  person  has  with  stutter-
ing  and  the  impact  it  is  having  on  the  life  of  the  person 
can  influence  the  path  someone  chooses  to  take  to  seek 
help.  As  a  profession,  we  need  to  gain  a  better  under-
standing  of  help-seeking  behavior  and  the  barriers  to  help-
seeking  so  we  can  develop  environments  and  pathways  to 
aid  that  would  be  beneficial  for  the  community  of  PWS.
