Abstract
Purpose: Parents have a vital role in the delivery of the Lidcombe Program when treating stuttering in young children.
Research into parent experiences and perceptions throughout the Lidcombe Program is currently limited. Qualitative
literature indicates that parent experiences and child progress are closely linked with program duration. This preliminary
quantitative study examined parent satisfaction with child fluency at three time points. Data from clinic and telehealth
delivery of the Lidcombe Program were used to further explore between-group non-inferiority.
Method: The data were drawn from a parallel, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial. Forty-nine children were
randomised to the clinic or telehealth group. Parent satisfaction ratings with child fluency, the percentage of syllables
stuttered and parent reported severity ratings were measured pre-treatment, 9 months and 18 months post-commencement
of treatment.
Result: An increase in parent satisfaction paralleled a decrease in stuttering severity across the three time points universally,
however, the relationship between parent satisfaction and stuttering severity was not found at every time point.
Conclusion: Though a general increase in parent satisfaction was seen as severity decreased, a global assumption on
satisfaction cannot be made based on stuttering severity when measured using an ordinal scale.

Introduction

Stuttering is a speech disorder characterised by the
disruption of fluency (World Health Organisation,
2015). Onset typically occurs between the ages of 2
and 4 (Lewis, Packman, Onslow, Simpson, & Jones,
2008), with the cumulative incidence reported to be
11.2% by 4 years (Reilly et al., 2013). Some pre-
school children will recover naturally without formal
speech treatment (Ma˚nsson, 2000; Yairi & Ambrose,
1999), and others will require formal intervention.
Treatment should commence prior to the school
years, as children become less responsive to therapy
with age (Packman, Onslow, & Attanasio, 2003). If
unresolved by adolescence, stuttering can become a
lifelong condition impacting various areas of life,
including education, employment, social relation-
ships and well-being (Iverach et al., 2009; Onslow,
Jones, O’Brian, Packman, & Menzies, 2012;
Packman & Onslow, 2012). Adolescents and adults
who stutter may experience persistent psychosocial
difficulties (Erickson & Block, 2013).

Stuttering may also impact the emotional, psy-
chological and social well-being of young children
who stutter (Langevin, Packman, & Onslow, 2010).
In a survey of 77 parents of children who stutter,
many reported observing child frustration with
stuttering,
verbal
output, comments on the inability to talk and
bullying from other children. Further, a significant
majority of parents felt that they were also affected
by their children’s stuttering in varying ways. These
included emotional distress, frustration, worry, self-
blame and uncertainty about what to do.

The Lidcombe Program

The Lidcombe Program is a stuttering treatment
designed for children younger than 6 years. The
program aims to eliminate or minimise stuttering
(Packman et al., 2016). The Lidcombe Program is
an operant treatment delivered primarily by the
parent under instruction from the clinician. Parents
are taught to rate their children’s stuttering severity

daily, and how to provide verbal contingencies for
stutter-free and stuttered speech. The program is
divided into two stages. During Stage 1, parents
provide verbal contingencies during daily practice
sessions. The child enters Stage 2 once they have
obtained minimal stuttering for three consecutive
clinic visits as determined by severity ratings (SRs)
observed within and beyond the consultation. Stage
2 is the maintenance phase where treatment
is
gradually withdrawn (refer to Packman et al., 2016
for further detail).

Evidence

(Bridgman, Onslow, O’Brian,

The Lidcombe Program has an extensive evidence
base, including Phase I trials (O’Brian, Smith, &
Onslow, 2014; Wilson, Onslow, & Lincoln, 2004),
Phase II trials (Jones et al., 2008; Lewis et al., 2008;
Rousseau, Packman, Onslow, Harrison, & Jones,
2007), and Phase III randomised controlled trials
(RCT)
Jones, &
Block, 2016; Harris, Onslow, Packman, Harrison,
& Menzies, 2002; Jones et al., 2005; Lattermann,
Euler, & Neumann, 2008). Onslow et al. (2012)
conducted a meta-analysis on Lidcombe Program
randomised controlled evidence, with a total of 134
participants. Children receiving the Lidcombe
Program were 7.5 times more likely to recover than
children who

not
Consequently, it appears that Lidcombe Program
treatment is more effective at eliminating persistent
stuttering than natural recovery. The evidence also
suggests that a median of 11 to 16 sessions are
required to complete Stage 1 (Jones, Onslow,
Harrison, & Packman, 2000; Lattermann et al.,
2008; Rousseau et al., 2007). Children who exhibit
severe stuttering, however, tend to take longer to
reach this point (Jones et al., 2000; Packman &
Onslow, 2012).

Telehealth delivery of the Lidcombe Program has
been investigated to increase timely access to evi-
dence-based early stuttering intervention. Both low-
tech (Lewis et al., 2008; Wilson et al., 2004) and
high-tech trials (Bridgman et al., 2016; O’Brian
et al., 2014) have yielded positive results. Low-tech
trials utilised telephone calls to consult with parents.
High-tech trials utilised webcam and the internet to
consult with parents and the child, allowing the
session to be conducted exactly as it would if the
child was in clinic. Bridgman et al. (2016) con-
ducted a Phase III RCT with 49 children, who were
randomly allocated to a clinic or telehealth group.
No significant between-group differences were
found in the number of sessions to complete Stage
1; with 21.6 sessions reported as the mean for clinic
delivery and 19.8 reported for telehealth. There was
also no significant between-group difference for the
level of stuttering reduction as measured by %SS.
Families found convenience and comfort to be the
main advantages to telehealth delivery.

While Lidcombe Program success relies on parent

researched parent perceptions and experiences.
Two qualitative studies interviewed parents about
their
the
Lidcombe Program (Goodhue, Onslow, Quine,
O’Brian, & Hearne, 2010; Hayhow, 2009). Both
studies suggest a relationship between satisfaction,
progression, stuttering severity and reduction. Some
parents of children with severe stuttering had diffi-
culty implementing treatment, while others found
treatment to be confusing and complex with slow
and inconsistent progress. In contrast, some parents
found the program satisfying and easy to administer
when stuttering reduced quickly and consistently.
Preliminary investigation of parent satisfaction with
fluency has been measured in several quantitative
studies (Jones et al., 2008; Lewis et al., 2008; Wilson
et al., 2004). Likert scale data indicated that many
participant parents are satisfied with their child’s
fluency in the later stages of therapy and post-
treatment. Therefore, the aim of this research was
to:

(1) determine whether stuttering severity was correlated
with parent satisfaction with child fluency (PSCF)
during treatment; and

(2) demonstrate a non-inferiority finding for parent
satisfaction between telehealth and clinic delivery of
the Lidcombe Program.

Method

The current research was retrospective, based on the
dataset from Bridgman et al. (2016). Bridgman et al.
(2016) conducted a parallel, open plan, non-infer-
iority RCT to examine treatment efficiency and
fluency outcomes between clinic and telehealth
delivery of the Lidcombe Program. Preschool chil-
dren who stuttered and their parents were recruited.
The current
research utilised both clinic and
telehealth data.

Participants

Participants were 49 children randomly allocated to
the clinic group (n ¼ 24) and telehealth group
(n ¼ 25). There were 37 boys and 12 girls; 5 girls
and 19 boys in the clinic group and 7 girls and 18
boys in the telehealth group. The age range for the
clinic group at initial assessment was 3 years 1
month to 5 years 11 months (M ¼ 4;2, SD ¼ 1;0)
and, for the telehealth group, it was 3 years 0 months
to 5 years 5 months (M ¼ 4;5, SD ¼ 0;9). All
children met the following inclusion criteria; (a)
aged between 3 years 0 months and 5 years 11
months at the beginning of treatment, (b) had been
stuttering for longer than 6 months, (c) diagnosis of
stuttering by consensus between parent and speech-
language pathologist, (d) home access to adequate
internet, and (e) parent and child both had

functional English skills. Children with a diagnosis
of a significant comorbid disorder or disability were
excluded; children presenting with speech or lan-
guage delays were not excluded.

Nine children withdrew throughout treatment.
Reasons for withdrawal included: child non-compli-
ance, treatment demands, difficulty attending regu-
lar appointments and poor Skype quality. Four
children withdrew from the clinic group, with an
attrition rate of 17%. Five children withdrew from
the telehealth group, with an attrition rate of 20%.
Dumville, Torgerson, and Hewitt (2006) suggested
that attrition rates of up to 20% are acceptable,
particularly when attrition rates are similar between
groups. Fisher’s exact test did not find a significant
difference in the attrition rates between the clinic
and telehealth groups, p ¼ 0.99.

Allocation

Randomisation was completed utilising a predeter-
mined schedule prepared by a biostatistician inde-
pendent of the study. Pre-treatment speech samples
were stratified based on a severity of above or below
5.0%SS (percentage of syllables stuttered). Overall,
42 children were stratified below 5.0%SS, and 7
children were stratified above 5.0%SS. Dynamically
balanced randomisation was utilised to ensure
equality in strata between the groups. Four children
above 5.0%SS were allocated to the telehealth
group, and three were allocated to the clinic group.
An unpaired t-test ((cid:2) ¼ 0.05) confirmed no signifi-
cant difference in severity between the clinic
and telehealth groups
(M ¼ 3.65, SD ¼ 3.97)
(M ¼ 3.71,
t(43) ¼
pre-treatment,
SD ¼ 3.04)
(cid:2)0.07, p ¼ 0 .95.

Outcome measures

Three outcome measures were used in this study; (1)
percentage of syllables stuttered (%SS), (2) parent
reported SRs, and (3) parent reported satisfaction
with child fluency. Each measure was collected pre-
randomisation, 9 months and 18 months post-
commencement of the Lidcombe Program.

Percentage of syllables stuttered
The primary outcome measure utilised to quantify
stuttering severity in Bridgman et al. (2016) was
%SS. The researcher who calculated %SS was
blinded to group allocation and time point. Ten-
minute speech samples were elicited with familiar
and unfamiliar communication partners at each time
point. The familiar communication partner was
usually a parent who was asked to speak naturally
with their child at home. The unfamiliar communi-
cation partner was an adult who did not live with the
child. This conversation took place outside of the
home. Both samples were recorded by a research
assistant via a telephone that was covertly placed near
the conversation, as detailed by O’Brian et al. (2010).

Unpaired t-tests ((cid:2) ¼ 0.05) revealed no difference in
%SS between familiar and unfamiliar communica-
tion partners, t(94) ¼ 0.66, p¼ 0.51, t(79) ¼ (cid:2)0.45,
p ¼ 0 .66, and t(58) ¼ 0.10, p¼ 0.92 (pre-treatment,
9 months and 18 months post-commencement of
the Lidcombe Program, respectively). Therefore, the
speech samples recorded with the familiar commu-
nication partner were used in this study as they were
the parent completing the SR and PSCF outcomes
measures.

Twenty percent of the samples were randomly
represented to the research assistant to determine
whether intra-observer reliability was acceptable.
Analysis with a Pearson’s correlation coefficient
found a 0.99 relationship between the samples.
Since acceptable correlations range from 0.94 to
0.99 within the literature (Harris et al., 2002;
Karimi, O’Brian, Onslow, & Jones, 2014; Koushik,
Shenker, & Onslow, 2009; Lattermann et al., 2008),
intra-observer reliability was deemed acceptable.
Twenty percent of the samples were also reassessed
by a second observer, to determine whether inter-
observer reliability was acceptable. Analysis with a
Pearson’s correlation coefficient found a 0.83 rela-
tionship between the two observers. Since accept-
able correlations range from 0.74 to 0.98 within the
literature (Harris et al., 2002; Karimi et al., 2014;
Koushik et al., 2009; Lattermann et al., 2008; Lewis
et al., 2008), inter-observer reliability was deemed
acceptable.

Severity ratings
At each assessment point, parents were asked
‘‘During the last week, what would have been your
child’s typical stuttering severity on any day?’’
Responses were measured with the Lidcombe
Program’s 10-point severity rating scale, where a
score of 1 ¼ no stuttering and a score of 10 ¼
extremely severe stuttering.

Parent satisfaction with child fluency
Parent reported satisfaction ratings were collected at
each assessment point. Parents were asked ‘‘How
satisfied are you with your child’s present level of
fluency?’’ with no additional prompts or meaning of
‘‘satisfied’’ provided. Responses were measured on a
10-point Likert scale, with a score of 1 ¼ extreme
satisfaction and a score of 10 ¼ total dissatisfaction.
A 10-point scale was used to remain consistent with
the Lidcombe Program 10-point severity rating
scale. These ratings were collected over the phone,
by a research assistant who was independent of the
treatment process.

Treatment

Lidcombe Program treatment was delivered to the
clinic group in a standard clinic setting, while the
telehealth group received treatment in their homes.

analyses with Tukey’s HSD revealed that SRs were
significantly lower for both clinic and telehealth
delivery, at 9 months and 18 months post-com-

SRs did not significantly differ between 9 months
and 18 months post-commencement, p40.05
(Table II).

Parent satisfaction with fluency
A one-way repeated-measures ANOVA examined
PSCF across the three time points. For both groups,
parent satisfaction was found to significantly vary
across the time points, F(2, 57) ¼ 31.70, p50.001
and F(2, 58) ¼ 36.36, p50.001 (clinic and tele-
health, respectively). Follow-up post hoc analyses
with Tukey’s HSD revealed significantly greater
parent satisfaction for both clinic and telehealth
delivery, at 9 months and 18 months post-com-
mencement of
the Lidcombe Program, p50.05
(Figure 3). For both groups, parent satisfaction did
not significantly differ between 9 months and 18
months post-commencement, p40.05 (Table II).

Unpaired t-tests compared PSCF between the
clinic and telehealth groups at each time point. Pre-
treatment, the clinic group (M ¼ 5.00, SD ¼ 1.93)
was significantly less dissatisfied with child fluency
than the telehealth group (M ¼ 6.54, SD ¼ 2.36),
t(43) ¼ (cid:2)2.46, p ¼ 0.02. At 9 months post com-

Table I details the median weeks and sessions

Data analysis

All analyses were conducted with Minitab Statistical
Software, version 17.2 (2015). An alpha level of 0.05
was the criterion of significance for all analyses. The
parent satisfaction rating was an ordinal variable.
Ordinal variables typically do not satisfy the assump-
tion of normality, which is usually deemed vital for
parametric tests (Harwell & Gatti, 2001). Norman
(2010), however, conducted analyses and reviewed
the literature for the use of parametric tests with
ordinal data. It was concluded that parametric tests,
and
including analysis of
Pearson’s correlation coefficient, were robust
to
deviations from normality with ordinal measures.
Furthermore, Heeren and D’Agostino (1987) found
that unpaired t-tests were robust with ordinal
datasets. Consequently, parametric tests were uti-
lised for all analyses.

Relationship between stuttering measures
and parent satisfaction with child fluency

First, a Pearson’s correlation coefficient examined
whether an association existed between %SS and
PSCF at the three time points. Table III depicts the
correlation coefficients
for both groups. The
strength of each significant correlation coefficient
was based on criterion from Mukaka (2012). For the
clinic group, parent satisfaction at 9 months post-
commencement had a moderate negative correlation
with %SS. At 18 months post-commencement, a
found between
strong negative correlation was
parent satisfaction and %SS. For the telehealth
group, parent satisfaction had a moderate negative
correlation with %SS at pre-treatment and 9 months
post-commencement. A significant correlation was

not found for the clinic group pre-treatment, or for
the
post-
telehealth
commencement.

Second, a Pearson’s correlation coefficient also
examined whether an association existed between
parent-reported SRs and PSCF at the three time
points. Table III depicts the correlation coefficients
for both groups. The strength of each significant
correlation coefficient was based on criterion from
Mukaka (2012). For the clinic group, parent satis-
faction at 9 months post-commencement had a

post-commencement, a strong negative correlation
was found between parent satisfaction and SRs.
For the telehealth group, parent satisfaction had a
weak negative correlation with SRs at pre-treatment,
and a strong negative correlation with SRs at 9

Secondary findings

The data at 9 months post-commencement of
Lidcombe Program treatment included children in
both Stage 1 and Stage 2 of the program. Further
analysis of the clinic group with an unpaired t-test
revealed that parent satisfaction for children in Stage
2 (M ¼ 1.92, SD ¼ 1.50) was greater than parent
satisfaction for children in Stage 1 (M ¼ 3.13,
SD ¼ 1.13). This finding, however, did not reach
significance,
p ¼ 0.05. A further
unpaired t-test found no significant difference in
%SS between children in Stage 1 (M ¼ 1.34,

SD ¼ 1.46), t(16) ¼ 0.80, p ¼ 0.44. Further analysis
of

revealed that parent satisfaction for children in

(M ¼ 0.97, SD ¼ 1.16), t(9) ¼ 1.64, p ¼ 0.13.

Discussion

This study of the Lidcombe Program sought to
investigate a relationship between PSCF and stut-
tering measurement across three time points, and
between clinic and telehealth delivery. Overall, the
trend during treatment progress suggests that a
decrease in stuttering generally relates to an increase
in satisfaction ratings for both service delivery
methods. Though parent satisfaction was closely
linked with child progress throughout treatment,
ratings were not consistently associated with severity
at each time point. For the clinic group, greater
parent satisfaction at 9 months and 18 months post-
commencement of
the Lidcombe Program was
associated with lower severity. For the telehealth
group, lower severity was associated with greater
satisfaction at pre-treatment and 9 months post-
commencement. No association was found for the
clinic group pre-treatment, or for the telehealth
group at 18 months post-commencement. This
suggests that PSCF may not be consistent with
stuttering severity for some parents.

These findings question the global assumption
clinicians make in clinical practice. Rather than
assuming parent satisfaction is related to stuttering
severity; clinicians would be best to directly ask
parents on a case basis. Further, this finding may
also suggest that in some cases parent perceived
progress may not be consistent with a child’s actual
progress. Finally, satisfaction at 9 months post-
commencement of the Lidcombe Program could be
indicative of satisfaction at 18 months post-com-
mencement as there was no significant difference
between these two assessment points for clinic or
telehealth groups. The non-inferiority hypothesis
was proved for parent satisfaction with fluency
between-groups at 9 months and 18 months post-
commencement of the Lidcombe Program. The
significant between-group difference in satisfaction
ratings prior to treatment was most likely the result
of chance given the randomised allocation method-
ology (Dettori, 2010).

Another variable to consider in parent satisfaction
with fluency appears to be the stage of the program
the child is in and how they have progressed. This is
supported by the 9 month data analysis of parent
satisfaction and %SS. This
assessment point
included children in both Stage 1 and Stage 2 of
the program. For the clinic group, eight children
were still
in Stage 1, whereas 13 children had
entered Stage 2. For the telehealth group, eight
children were still in Stage 1, whereas 14 children

had entered Stage 2. Telehealth parents in Stage 1
were found to be significantly less satisfied with child
fluency when compared to parents with children in
Stage 2. Clinic parents demonstrated a similar
pattern, however the finding just missed reaching
statistical significance (p ¼ 0.05). Given that this
study did not find a statistically significant difference
in %SS between children in Stage 1 and children in
Stage 2 for either groups, it is postulated that parent
satisfaction with their children’s fluency is greater
once they have completed Stage 1, regardless of the
%SS.

Finally, the correlation and ANOVA calculations
showed no difference between stuttering measures
used in analysis (%SS or SR). This supports the
findings from Karimi et al. (2014) of similar intra-
judge and inter-judge reliability of %SS and SR, and
Onslow et al. (in press), who found no statistical
reason to prefer %SS over SRs as a primary outcome
measure for clinical research in early stuttering
intervention.

Clinical application

throughout

Findings indicate a potentially symbiotic, negative
correlation between PSCF and stuttering severity as
reported SRs.
measured by %SS or parent
Consequently, PSCF could be considered an
optional measure
the Lidcombe
Program. Ratings could be collected on a regular
basis and compared with SRs. Inconsistencies could
prompt the clinician to seek qualitative information
from the parent about what they view to be the goals
of treatment, and what would ultimately increase
their child’s
their satisfaction or acceptance of
fluency.

This measure could also be used in the assess-
ment process to assist with decisions relating to
monitoring for natural recovery versus commencing
direct treatment. Low satisfaction ratings with child
fluency may provide an indicator for treatment
commencement without a waiting period, as imme-
diate therapy is recommended for parents experien-
from child stuttering
cing negative
(Langevin et al., 2010). Satisfaction ratings may
also provide an indicator of a parent’s level of
concern with their child’s stuttering. Further factors
that may impact parent satisfaction would relate to
personal or family history of stuttering and speech
disorder, comments from family, friends or educa-
tion, parent’s natural threshold for anxiety, compet-
the child
ing lifestyle demands or
themselves may have communicated.

the insight

impacts

This study adds further support for telehealth
delivery of the Lidcombe Program. The same trend
was found for both service delivery methods, where
a decrease in severity paralleled an increase in
satisfaction with child fluency. This finding provides
further evidence that telehealth delivery is no differ-
to clinic delivery in terms of efficacy and
ent

efficiency (Bridgman et al., 2016). The impact of this
finding is great, as telehealth delivery can provide
greater access to treatment for families who have
difficulty attending or receiving clinic-based services
(O’Brian et al., 2014; Onslow et al., 2012).

Limitations

References

These findings are limited to the current study, as
this is the first Lidcombe Program research study to
examine PSCF for clinic and telehealth delivery, and
presented in the context of a retrospective study.
Future prospective studies could investigate what
‘‘satisfaction’’ means to each parent through quali-
tative interviewing and include assessing or review-
ing parent satisfaction at more frequent intervals.

This study does not consider long-term PSCF
post-treatment. Though PSCF is greatest at 18
months post-commencement, it is unknown whether
ratings remain stable or alter following therapy. Nine
children withdrew from the current study; however,
the current
research did not consider whether
dissatisfaction with child fluency contributed to
withdrawal. Findings from this research are limited
to a metropolitan sample. Given that beliefs and
attitudes towards healthcare can differ between rural
and metropolitan communities (Dixon & Welch,
2000), future research should consider rural and
remote delivery of the Lidcombe Program. This may
offer further insight into PSCF.

Conclusion

Although PSCF parallels a decrease in severity
throughout the Lidcombe Program, a global assump-
tion on parent satisfaction cannot be made based on
stuttering severity as measured by %SS or parent
reported SRs. Clinicians could consider using parent
satisfaction ratings with child fluency throughout the
Lidcombe Program as an additional measure to
provide further insight into parent perceptions and
how these may impact the treatment process.
