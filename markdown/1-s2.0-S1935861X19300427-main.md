A single case report of a patient with stuttering who improved after
open label TMS

To the editor

Developmental stuttering is a speech disorder that occurs in
spontaneous communication situations. It is characterized by rep-
etitions, prolongations, or blocks during normal speech. Onset of
stuttering is typically between 2 and 5 years of age. Stuttering
has a prevalence of around 5% in early childhood, but many children
recover spontaneously; thus, the prevalence across the general
population is closer to 1% [1]. Adults who stutter (AWS) develop
secondary behaviors, such as body and facial tics, and physiological
(increased adrenaline and heart rate) and psychological (anxiety
and depression) symptoms, associated with this phenomenon.
These severely compromise AWS's quality of life.

The etiology and mechanisms underlying stuttering still remain
unknown, and limited effective treatments are available for those
affected. Speech-relevant cortical and subcortical neural systems
appear to be malfunctioning in developmental stuttering, both in
speech tasks and in non-speech tasks [2].

Transcranial direct current stimulation has shown a favorable
effect on ﬂuency in AWS [3]. To date, to the best of our knowledge,
no previous published studies have investigated the effects of re-
petitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in patients with
developmental stuttering. Previous reports [4,5] indicate that the
most critical region for neuromodulation in stuttering is the left pu-
tamen (not accessible by TMS), left inferior frontal gyrus (tested in
Ref. [3]) and supplementary motor area (SMA). We assessed the ef-
fect of rTMS at the SMA in a 30-year-old, right-handed man with
developmental stuttering, as stuttering severity is related to
increased structural connectivity of the motor response-inhibition
network (composed of the supramarginal gyrus, preSMA, subthala-
mic nucleus, and putamen) [6]. The study adhered to the principles
of the Helsinki Declaration for medical research involving human
participants (World Medical Association, 2013) and oral informed

To evaluate stuttering severity, two 3-min speech videorecorder
samples were collected during spontaneous conversation before
treatment and after every 5 treatment sessions. Each conversation
sample involved new neutral topics (i.e., furniture). For each pair of
samples, the percentage of disﬂuent syllables (%DS), deﬁned as
those containing repetition, prolongation, repeated phrases, or
phrase revision, or blocks prior to a speech sound (core stuttering
characteristics) were measured. In addition, SSI-4, a standardized
and norm-referenced index of disﬂuency [7], was used to charac-
terize stuttering severity. Inter-rater reliability was measured by

comparing our speech sample assessments with those of an inde-
pendent, registered Speech and Language Therapist (A.G.).

Excitatory 10 Hz rTMS was delivered to the bilateral SMA
(Fig. 1A) on 15 consecutive working days. TMS was applied through
an air-cooled 70-mm ﬁgure-of-eight coil, using a Rapid2 Stimulator
(Magstim, Whitland, UK). The targeted area was identiﬁed through
Brain Voyager neuronavigation software (Zebris CMS20S, Warwick-
shire, UK) on brain images obtained by MRI (Intera 1.5 T; Philips,
Best, The Netherlands). Sixty trains of 10 Hz rTMS at 120% of resting
motor threshold were delivered for 5 s, with 25-s inter-train inter-
vals. Overall, a total of 3000 pulses were applied per session. During
the inter-train interval, the subject read aloud, following a 120-bpm
metronome, to induce as much ﬂuency as possible. The guidelines
for safe use of rTMS were followed [8]. No adverse events were
recorded.

We found a signiﬁcant decrease in %DS and SSI-4 score after 5
rTMS sessions; the ﬂuency improvement was maintained during
the subsequent 10 sessions (Fig. 1B), and a ﬁnal 36% decrease in
SSI-4 score (from 30, moderate, to 19, mild) and a 28% decrease
in %DS were obtained. The patient reported “fewer and less intense
blocks than before treatment.” A high intraclass correlation (ICC)
(ICC ¼ 0.91,
was
P < 0.001), indicating a high level of reliability. No other signiﬁcant
changes were detected.

To visualize the induced electric ﬁeld, a software simulation
SimNIBS (www.simnibs.de) using an 8-type coil positioned on a
realistic head model, with an 11.6 cm radius, in the same position
as for the subject, was used. Three-dimensional distribution of
the electric ﬁeld modulus is shown in Fig. 1C. The preSMA and
SMA were the main regions in which the electric ﬁeld was induced,
although the premotor cortex and frontal areas also received
stimulation.

Stuttering has been describing as a motor and timing disorder
[9]. Characterizing the functional differences and strength of con-
nectivity of component areas might help elucidate possible mech-
anisms of speech disﬂuencies manifested as stuttering. A previous
report [10] suggested that dysfunctional activation of the SMA
may contribute to insufﬁcient activation of motor structures of
the left hemisphere, followed by an exaggerated reaction of the
temporal/motor structures of the right hemisphere, which then
interfere with speech production. As the pre-SMA/SMA support
movement initiation and timing, this case study might supports
that hypothesis, raising the possibility that SMA stimulation may

subcorticalecortical pathways that interfere with correct motor
speech initiation.

To our knowledge, no previous study has used rTMS successfully
as a therapy for stuttering. This case illustrated that rTMS over the
SMA could be a promising way of research in more subjects, along
with sham stimulation, both as therapy and to explore pathophys-
iological principals of stuttering.
