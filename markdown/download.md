Purpose: To verify the auditory processing abilities and occurrence of the suppression effect of Otoacoustic 
Emissions (OAE) in individuals who stutter.  Methods: The study sample comprised 15 adult individuals who 
stutter, aged 18-40 years, with stuttering severity ranging from mild to severe, paired according to gender, age, 
and schooling with individuals without speech complaint or disorder. All participants underwent conventional 
clinical evaluation, specific stuttering assessment, and basic (audiometry, imitanciometry, and measurement 
of acoustic reflexes) and specific (auditory processing evaluation and measurement of suppression effect of 
OAEs) audiological assessments. Data were statistically analyzed with application of the Fisher’s Exact Test 
and the Mann-Whitney Test.  Results: The group of individuals who stutter (Study Group – SG) presented 
higher incidence of auditory processing disorders. The auditory processing assessments used to differentiate 
the groups of stutterers and non-stutterers (Control Group – CG) were the Nonverbal Dichotic Test and the 
Frequency Pattern Test. The SG presented higher incidence of absence of suppression effect of OAEs, indicating 
abnormal functioning of the efferent medial olivocochlear system. Conclusion: The auditory processing abilities 
investigated in this study differentiate individuals who stutter from non-stutterers, with greater changes in the 
first. Functioning of the efferent medial olivocochlear system showed a deficit in stutterers, indicating difficulties 
in auditory discrimination, especially in the presence of noise.

INTRODUCTION

Stuttering  is  described  as  the  involuntary  disruption  of 
continuous  speech  production.  It  is  directly  associated  with 
desynchronized  neuropsycholinguistic  processes  that  do  not 
allow the speaker to avoid interruptions in the continuous flow 
of speech(1,2). Stuttering is a complex disorder that can be easily 
recognized as an impairment of motor nature due to its characteristic 
disruptions. However, aiming at a better understanding of the 
framework  of  this  disorder,  the  numerous  models  currently 
seeking to explain stuttering consider atypical neurophysiology, 
genetic and environmental factors, learning abilities, auditory 
processing, and speech and language production skills(1,3).

Some  studies  have  investigated  the  sensory  abilities  of 
individuals  who  stutter  focusing  on  aspects  related  to  sight, 
touch, movement, and hearing, indicating how these mechanisms 
contribute and act in conjunction with the motor mechanism to 
achieve adequate speech production(2).

Due to studies that have verified improvement in stuttered 
speech  during  auditory  feedback  modifications  in  some 
individuals who stutter, auditory skills have become the subject 
of increasingly complex investigations. Studies have investigated 
auditory complaints, the action of middle ear muscles, and the 
functioning of the central auditory system, also using imaging 
tests(4,5), aiming to associate hearing development with dysfluent 
speech(6).

Some studies have demonstrated the relationship between 
auditory  information  processing  and  stuttering(3,6).  However, 
no studies have been conducted on the suppression effect of 
otoacoustic emissions on stuttering individuals.

Research on the suppression effect of otoacoustic emissions 
provides information on the functioning of the efferent medial 
olivocochlear system, which is associated with auditory processing 
and tasks of auditory discrimination, high frequency selectivity, 
and speech intelligibility, especially in noisy environments(7-9). 
Absence of suppression has been observed in individuals with 
learning disabilities and language disorder, as well as in patients 
with speech discrimination impairment in noisy environments, 
but no studies investigating it in stuttering have been found.

The understanding of these auditory mechanisms could assist 
with better adaptation of the mechanisms of auditory feedback 
modification in individuals who stutter.

Based on these assumptions, the objective of the present 
study  was  to  verify  the  auditory  processing  abilities  and 
occurrence of the suppression effect of otoacoustic emissions 
in individuals who stutter.

METHODS

This  transversal,  observational,  analytical  study  with 
comparison between groups was approved by the Research Ethics 
Committee of the aforementioned Institution under protocol no. 
0604/09. All  participants  signed  an  Informed  Consent  Form 
(ICF) prior to study commencement. Data collection occurred 
at the Speech-language Pathology and Audiology Assessment 
and Diagnostics Outpatient Clinics of a public hospital located 
in the municipality of Sao Paulo between 2009 and 2011.

The study sample was composed of 30  adult individuals 
equally divided into two groups: Study Group (SG) and Control 
Group  (CG). The  SG  comprised  15  individuals  who  stutter, 
of both genders, aged 18 to 40 years. The following inclusion 
criteria were applied to compose the study sample: pure-tone 
audiometry within the normality patterns and type A tympanometry 
curve;  complaint  about  stuttering  with  manifestation  onset 
during  childhood  and  condition  persistence;  a  minimum  of 
3%  of  atypical  dysfluencies  in  the  samples  of  spontaneous 
speech and reading; and minimum score of  18 points in the 
Stuttering Severity Instrument-3 (SSI-3)(10). Fifteen individuals 
were selected in the community to composed the CG and were 
paired according to age, gender, and schooling with those of the 
SG; they should present no complaint and/or communication 
disorders, pure-tone audiometry within normality patterns and 
type A tympanometry curve, and a minimum of 2% of atypical 
dysfluencies in the samples of spontaneous speech and reading.
All individuals in the SG and CG underwent conventional 
speech-language  pathology  evaluation  (anamnesis  and 
communication assessment), specific fluency assessment, and 
basic and specific audiological assessments.

Specific speech fluency assessment was performed through 
the  mapping  of  typical  (hesitation,  interjection,  revision, 
repetition of words, phrase repetition, and unfinished words) 
and atypical (repetition of the same word three or more times, 
syllable repetition, sound repetition, prolongation, intrusion, and 
block) dysfluencies(10,11). To this end, recordings of spontaneous 
speech and reading were performed in an acoustically treated 
room using a Sony® manufactured digital camcorder connected 
to  a  headset  microphone.  Subsequently,  200  fluent  syllables 
of  the  speech  samples  were  canonically  transcribed  and  the 
dysfluencies were mapped into typical and atypical according 
to the criteria described in the specific scientific literature(10,11). 
The diagnostic criterion for stuttering considered the presence 
of at least 3% of atypical dysfluencies. The degree of severity of 
stuttering was estimated by the Stuttering Severity Instrument-3 
(SSI-3) protocol(10). A minimum score of 18 points was adopted 
with the intention to exclude mild degree stuttering.

Pure-tone  audiometry  was  conducted  using  an  MA-41 
audiometer in acoustic booth with search for 250 to 8000 Hz 
thresholds. Acoustic immittance measures included tympanometry 
with  a  226  Hz  probe  tone  and  contralateral  and  ipsilateral 
acoustic  reflex  thresholds  at  frequencies  of  500,  1000,  2000 
and 4000 Hz, using an AZ-7 immittanciometer.

In  the Auditory  Processing  assessment,  behavioral  tests 
were conducted in acoustic booth using a two-channel clinical 
audiometer connected to a CD player; these tests evaluated the 
performance of individuals in the solution of a task of difficult 
listening.  Tests  involving  different  auditory  processes  were 
used, both with verbal and non-verbal stimuli. The following 
tests  were  selected:  Speech-in-noise  (SIN)  Test,  Nonverbal 
Dichotic Test, Alternate Dissyllable Dichotic Test (Staggered 
Spondaic Word - SSW), Duration Pattern Test; Synthetic Sentence 
Identification (SSI) tests under the conditions of competitive 
contralateral message (SSI-CCM) and ipsilateral competitive 
message (SSI-ICM), Frequency Pattern Test, and Random Gap 
Detection Test (RGDT).

The search for Transient-evoked Otoacoustic Emissions (TEOAE) 
was conducted in acoustic booth using the ILO96-Otodynamics 
analyzer. The search used non-linear clicks with regular pulses 
of  80  milliseconds  (ms)  of  duration,  with  rarefied  polarity, 
presented in a series of 260 cycles per second, within a 20 ms 
window. Emission spectrum of the standard stimulus contained 
energy distributed between 0.5 and 5 kHz. Presence of response 
was considered for occurrence of emissions higher than 3 dB 
of noise in the frequency bands of 1000 to 4000 Hz(12), with 
response reproducibility and probe stability >70%.

Regarding the suppression effect of otoacoustic emissions, the 
technique used followed the same aforementioned procedures; 
however, TEOAEs were performed in threefold: two with no 
noise with a 30 second-interval between procedures and one 
with contralateral broadband noise at 60 dBNPS. Stimulation 
was conducted using clicks at 75 dBpeNPS and the noise was 
emitted through a TDH-39P headset of an MA-18 audiometer.
In order not to alter the placement of the probe between 
procedures, the handset and the probe were previously positioned, 
without modification throughout the examination. The analysis 
was performed in both ears, with the test starting in the right ear 
for half of the participants and in the left ear for the other half.
Recording of the TEOAEs, with determination of the amplitudes 
of responses, was performed at three moments: at time 1 (T1), 
the responses, named Responses 1 (R1), were obtained in the 
absence of contralateral noise; 15 seconds after the end of R1 
assessment, that is, at time 2 (T2), the Responses 2 (R2) were 
recorded  under  the  same  conditions  previously  described; 
15 seconds after the end of R2 assessment, that is, at time 3 
(T3), the Responses 3 (R3) were obtained in the presence of 
suppression noise (Figure 1).

Occurrence and amplitude of suppression effect were verified 
comparing the variation of the general response values in each 
ear, in the presence and absence of suppression noise, according 
to international recommendation(13).

To  this  end,  the  following  calculation  was  performed: 
difference between the R1 and R2 values (D1) and difference 
between the R1 and R3 values (D2) (Figure 2).

Therefore, attenuation of the overall response amplitude of 
the TEOAEs by the suppression noise, the so-called suppression 
effect,  was  considered  present  when  D2  >  D1. A  minimum 
variation of 0.5 dB NPS in the overall response should also 
occur for the suppression effect be considered present. In this 
case, it was considered that the efferent medial olivocochlear 
auditory system would be functioning.

For the inferential statistical analysis of the sample data, 
the nature of the variables (qualitative/quantitative) and their 
subtypes, e.g., continuous, ordinal, and discrete, were verified. 
The discrete variables were considered continuous due to their 
approximation  to  normality.  In  the  case  of  the  continuous 
quantitative variables, normality (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) 
and  homogeneity  (Levèné  test)  of  variance  were  explored 
aiming to verify the assumptions for the use of parametric or 
non-parametric  testing  for  the  difference  of  means  between 
the groups of individuals who stutter and non-stutters; when 
both characteristics of the variables were preserved (normality 
and homogeneity), the Student’s t-test was applied, whereas 
when  at  least  one  of  those  characteristics  was  violated,  the 
Mann-Whitney test was used. The Chi-square test and, when 
necessary, the Fisher’s exact test, were applied to verify the 
association between two dichotomous variables. A significance 
level of 5% (p<0.05) was adopted for all statistical analyses.

RESULTS

Table 1 shows the results of the Auditory Processing assessment 
comparing  the  study  and  control  groups.  No  difference  was 
observed between the Study (SG) and Control (CG) Groups 
regarding their performance in the verbal tests, as presented 
in Table 2.

With respect to the non-verbal tests, statistically significant 
difference was found between the groups (Table 3) especially for 
the Nonverbal Dichotic Test (p=0.04) and the Frequency Pattern 
Test (p=0.05), with worse performance in the SG. No statistically 
significant differences were observed between the groups in the 
other tests: Random Gap Detection Test (RGDT) and Duration 
Pattern Test (p>0.999).

The occurrence of suppression effect of otoacoustic emissions 

in both groups is presented in Table 4.

DISCUSSION

The findings of the present study indicated higher incidence 
of auditory processing disorders in the group of individuals who 
stutter. These alterations are characterized as a differential in the 
comparison between individuals who stutter and non-stutters, and 
the chance of adult individuals who stutter present this disorder 
is approximately 60.7 times that of non-stutters. This result was 
expected,  considering  that  national  and  international  studies 
have reported auditory processing difficulties in children and 
adults who stutter(3,13-16).

Such  changes  in  auditory  processing  result  in  decreased 
ability to produce auditory perception patterns in individuals 
who  stutter.  Temporal  inaccuracy  in  speech  perception  may 
lead to moments of dysfluency, and decreased processing skills 
may be related to the inability to maintain fluent speech(14,17).

Disabilities of auditory nature are manifested in a variety of 
ways. Some studies have shown evidence of decreased activity 
in the left auditory cortex prior to speech-language therapy and 
normal or improved activity levels immediately after therapy(3).
Other studies have indicated neuroanatomical differences 
between  individuals  who  stutter  and  non-stutterers(18,19). 
Some  other  studies  have  demonstrated  decreased  auditory 
cortex activation and hyperactivation of the motor regions(5). 
Greater left hemisphere activity and differences in wave amplitude 
have  also  been  observed  in  P300  analyses  after  therapeutic 
interventions(20). These analyses are directly related to the areas 
activated during auditory and speech processing and provide 
evidence of anomalous brain functioning not only during speech 
production,  but  also  during  reception.  Differences  in  brain 
responses directly associated with the processing of auditory 
information are observed either during auditory tasks or during 
speech(3,14,17,21).

Statistically significant differences were observed between 
the Study (SG) and Control (CG) groups in the tests that use 
non-verbal stimuli (p<0.001). In addition, comparative inferential 
analysis of the performance of the SG and CG in relation to 
each of the auditory processing tests verified that, in the present 
study, only the Non-verbal Dichotic Test and the Frequency 
Pattern Test presented statistically significant differences, with 
inferior performance of the SG.

Both the Frequency Pattern Test and the Non-verbal Dichotic 
Test  are  related  to  the  so-called  suprasegmental  aspects  of 
speech,  in  which  prosody  and  speech  rhythm  are  involved 
(non-verbal aspects). The changes found in these types of tests 
can be attributed to the difficulty in acquiring or storing pieces 
of information that occur over time, which may interfere with 

the tonicity aspects of the language, as well as affect the speech 
of individuals. A study demonstrated that prosodic processing is 
one of the fundamental elements to understand stuttering, with 
regard to its rhythmic impairment characteristic(11).

A  survey  conducted  with  children  who  stutter(14)  verified 
lower performance in the Frequency Pattern Test, a result similar 
to that obtained in this study with adults.

Temporal processing is directly related to speech perception; 
therefore, it is important to apply this type of test to individuals 
who stutter.

Some studies have associated the occurrence of difficulties in 
auditory information processing with absence of the suppression 
effect(9,22-24).  Because  of  this,  and  based  on  the  extensive 
discussion on the occurrence of auditory processing disorders 
in individuals who stutter found in the literature, suppression 
effect was investigated comparing the individuals in the study 
and  control  groups  (Table  4).  Inferential  statistical  analysis 
performed using the Fisher’s exact test verified lower occurrence 
of the suppression effect in individuals who stutter (46.6%). 
It was also possible to observe that the chance of an individual 
in the SG not exhibit suppression effect is 16 times that of an 
individual in the CG not exhibit the same effect.

Therefore, it can be stated that the Efferent Medial Olivocochlear 
System of the studied individuals who stutter presented hearing 
physiological inadequacy owing to absence of the suppression 
effect, which results in reduction of the inhibitory effect of the 
efferent system.

No reports on suppression effect in individuals who stutter 
have  been  described  in  the  literature.  However,  it  is  known 
that the suppression effect is one of the ways to analyze the 
Efferent Medial Olivocochlear System, whose role in auditory 
performance has not yet been fully defined, but some functions 
have already been clearly attributed to it, such as location of 
the  sound  source,  improved  sensitivity,  auditory  attention, 
protection, and improved detection of acoustic signals in the 
presence of noise(9,23-25).

Higher occurrence of processing disorders and suppression 
of emissions was observed in the investigated individuals who 
stutter. Based on these findings, further research is needed to 
better understand the correlation between auditory and stuttering 
disorders in order to establish a clearer relationship between 
them and, consequently, provide a better indication of systems 
of auditory feedback modification as a therapeutic resource - a 
theme  that  has  been  frequently  addressed  by  studies  in  this 
area(26-30).

CONCLUSION

In  conclusion,  the  auditory  aspects  of  individuals  who 
stutter are different from those of non-stutterers, with deficient 
functioning  of  the  efferent  medial  olivocochlear  system  and 
greater incidence of auditory processing alterations.
