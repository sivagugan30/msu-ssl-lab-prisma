Efficacy of aripiprazole in severe, persistent, socially- and occupationally-impairing developmental
stuttering

T

1. Case report

A 26-year-old male with severe, persistent, socially- and occupa-
tionally-impairing developmental stuttering, diagnosed at age 5 years,
requested medication for improving speech fluency. He had undergone
iterations of speech therapy since age 6 years; there was negligible
improvement. One year earlier, his Stuttering Severity Instrument,
Version 4 (SSI4) score was 44, indicating very severe stuttering; after
multiple sessions of fluency modulating therapy during the year, the
SSI4 reading ratings improved from 9/10 to 1/10; however, there was
no improvement in conversational subcomponents, and his SSI4 score
at presentation was 35, indicating severe impairment. He had also been
diagnosed with major depression one month earlier and had improved
with 5 mg/day of escitalopram.

He was started on aripiprazole 2.5 mg/day; aripiprazole was se-
lected because of its favorable tolerability profile. The dose was upti-
trated to 5 mg/day on day 3. He reported dramatic, global improve-
ments in speech on day 9, as though “a light bulb had been switched
on". There was marked improvement across all conversational tasks
with strangers as well as friends. There was marked reduction in as-
sociated impairments, including facial grimacing, spasmodic move-
ments, and head and extremity movements during speech. He was rated
as much improved on the Clinical Global Impression - Improvement
Scale.

Aripiprazole induced bradykinesia, hand tremors, and mild aka-
thisia. The dose was therefore reduced to 2.5 mg/day and trihex-
yphenidyl 1 mg/day was added. The extrapyramidal adverse effects
attenuated, but speech fluency worsened. Trihexyphenidyl was with-
drawn, resulting in improvement of fluency. However, because extra-
pyramidal adverse effects reemerged and were intolerable, 3 months
after initiation of therapy aripiprazole was tapered and withdrawn. His
speech rapidly returned to pretreatment disfluent levels. The patient
declined treatment with other antipsychotic drugs.

reason for impaired speech fluency (Alm, 2004). This is postulated to be
secondary to high density of D2 receptors and low D1:D2 ratio in the
putamen (Civier et al., 2011), aberrant dopamine release, and focal
lesions of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits (Van Borsel et al.,
1998). These provide a basis for using dopamine receptor antagonists in
PDS. However, these do not explain why extrapyramidal symptoms
developed with even a low dose of aripiprazole.

In our patient, fluency improved with aripiprazole and worsened
after aripiprazole discontinuation; and it worsened with trihex-
yphenidyl initiation and improved after trihexyphenidyl withdrawal.
These changes were pronounced, and suggested that PDS may improve
with dopamine receptor modulation and worsen with cholinergic an-
tagonism. The findings are consistent with the knowledge that dopa-
mine and acetylcholine are antagonistic neurotransmitters in the ni-
grostriatal system.

There is at least one report of aripiprazole-induced stuttering
(Rocha, 2009). However, our experience supports its use as a treatment
for the condition (Tran et al., 2008; Hoang et al., 2016). It is surprising
that there have been no clinical trials in the field. The time is ripe for a
open label trial with long-term follow up, if not for a randomized
controlled trial.

2. Discussion

Despite progress over recent years, the precise pathophysiology of
stuttering remains obscure. Basal ganglia dysfunction is one of the
many proposed theories of stuttering causation. Impaired ability of the
basal ganglia to produce timing cues is believed to be the primary

article.
