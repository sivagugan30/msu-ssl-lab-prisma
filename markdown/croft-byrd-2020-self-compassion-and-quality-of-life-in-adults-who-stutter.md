Self-Compassion and Quality of Life
in Adults Who Stutter

Robyn L. Crofta

and Courtney T. Byrda

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify levels
of self-compassion in adults who do and do not stutter
and to determine whether self-compassion predicts the
impact of stuttering on quality of life in adults who stutter.
Method: Participants included 140 adults who do and do
not stutter matched for age and gender. All participants
completed the Self-Compassion Scale. Adults who stutter
also completed the Overall Assessment of the Speaker’s
Experience of Stuttering. Data were analyzed for self-
compassion differences between and within adults who
do and do not stutter and to predict self-compassion on
quality of life in adults who stutter.
Results: Adults who do and do not stutter exhibited no
significant differences in total self-compassion, regardless

of participant gender. A simple linear regression of
the total self-compassion score and total Overall
Assessment of the Speaker’s Experience of Stuttering
score showed a significant, negative linear relationship
of self-compassion predicting the impact of stuttering
on quality of life.
Conclusions: Data suggest that higher levels of self-
kindness, mindfulness, and social connectedness
(i.e., self-compassion) are related to reduced negative
reactions to stuttering, an increased participation in
daily communication situations, and an improved
overall quality of life. Future research should replicate
current findings and identify moderators of the self-
compassion–quality of life relationship.

D espite similar overt behaviors, including sound or

syllable repetitions, prolongations, or inaudible
blocks, people who stutter (PWS) vary widely

both in stuttering frequency and internal reactions to their
stuttering moments. Thus, stuttering and the relative impact
cannot be measured by the frequency or severity of the overt
behavior. Rather, stuttering is a multifaceted experience
that often results in feelings of shame, isolation, lost con-
trol, and avoidance. For many, these negative feelings can
interfere with vocational, academic, social, and personal
achievement and have a profound impact on overall quality
of life (Boyle, 2013; Bricker-Katz et al., 2009; Craig et al.,
2009; Daniels et al., 2012).

The Impact of Stuttering on Quality of Life

Quality of life is broadly conceptualized as an indi-

vidual’s well-being across multidimensional contexts, includ-
ing physical, psychological, social, and vocational domains

(Craig et al., 2009). Quantitative and qualitative studies
indicate that PWS experience increased emotional distress
(Craig et al., 2011; Tichenor & Yaruss, 2018), negative
affect (Iverach et al., 2010), self-deprecation (Corcoran &
Stewart, 1998), and anxiety (Boyle, 2015). Research also
demonstrates a strong relationship between these factors
and quality of life. For example, Craig et al. (2009) mea-
sured the impact of stuttering on quality of life indicators,
such as mental health (i.e., feelings of anxiety and depres-
sion), vitality (i.e., energy levels), and social functioning.
Results from 200 adults who stutter and 200 adults who
do not stutter indicated that PWS scored significantly lower
in vitality, social and emotional function, and mental health
compared to their fluent peers, revealing the unique social
and psychological ramifications of stuttering. Similarly, Boyle
and Fearon (2018) found that adults who stutter (n = 397)
with higher levels of stigma awareness and application
(i.e., awareness of and internalization of the public’s nega-
tive beliefs about stuttering) experienced increased stress
and decreased physical health, both strong predictors of
life quality.

Historically and recently, qualitative studies suggest

that PWS may experience adverse listener reactions to stut-
tering that can result in quality of life consequences. In
1998, a qualitative analysis of interview narratives of eight
adults who stutter revealed a core theme of “suffering,”

during, and after stuttering moments (Corcoran & Stewart,
1998). Much of this suffering stemmed from negative inter-
nal reactions to listener insensitivity, such as listeners who
laughed, avoided eye contact, or mocked them. More re-
cently, a phenomenological analysis demonstrated that PWS
experience the negative influence of listener reactions on
moments of stuttering (Tichenor & Yaruss, 2018). One
participant shared:

“And then that’s usually when the listener starts giving
me the look, why is this person not saying anything?
And I know that I’m doing something. I’m trying to
get my speech moving again but the listener is kind of
sitting there looking at you and thinking “what’s this
guy’s problem?” (p. 1118)

Given that PWS are frequently subjected to these

types of exchanges, they may benefit from a practice that
helps to mitigate adverse reactions. One such practice is
self-compassion.

Self-Compassion Overview

Self-compassion is characterized by an open, caring,

and nonjudgmental response to one’s own thoughts and
feelings, especially in the face of negative experiences or
emotions. Three primary components define self-compassion:
mindfulness, self-kindness, and common humanity (Neff,
2003). Contrary to overidentifying with or ruminating on
negative emotions, mindfulness is a nonjudgmental aware-
ness in which each thought and feeling is observed and
accepted, rather than judged as “good” or “bad” (Segal
et al., 2002; Shapiro & Schwartz, 2000). Mindfulness is
characterized by an open, curious, and accepting attitude
toward one’s living experience (Kabat-Zinn, 1994; Neff
& Germer, 2017). Self-kindness refers to the extension of
warmth, care and concern rather than criticism (Neff, 2009).
In practice, self-kindness might mean using a gentle tone
when talking to one’s self and using affirming language.
Doing so can result in “holding” suffering with care and
concern, rather than self-criticizing. Finally, common hu-
manity recognizes that suffering is a part of the human ex-
perience and that no one is alone in experiencing feelings
of pain or inadequacy. In practice, common humanity
means remembering that others have been through some-
thing similar or forming a supportive social network. Taken
together, self-compassion can be considered as an uncon-
ditional support for self, resulting in a sense of psychologi-
cal safety even after a negative experience.

The therapeutic property of self-compassion stems
from the social mentality theory, which draws upon the
evolutionary biology, neurobiology, and attachment theory
to describe humans’ tendency to seek support and resources
during times of need (Gilbert, 2000; Hermanto & Zuroff,
2016). When people seek support from others or, in the
case of self-compassion, give support to themselves, they
deactivate the threat system (i.e., the sympathetic nervous
system) and activate the self-soothing system (i.e., the

parasympathetic nervous system) by reducing cortisol and
heart rate (Arch et al., 2016; Gilbert, 2000; Luo et al., 2018).
Thus, when distressed individuals observe their thoughts,
treat themselves kindly, and relate their experience to others,
they experience physiological and psychological decreases in
stress. The benefit of self-compassion for increasing psycho-
logical flexibility, positive affect, and self-efficacy and de-
creasing rumination, negative affect, and state anxiety has
been demonstrated widely both in nonclinical (Arch et al.,
2018; Babenko & Oswald, 2019) and clinical (Bakker et al.,
2019; Ford et al., 2016) populations.

Self-Compassion and Quality of Life Outcomes

In studies conducted with individuals without a speci-
fied clinical diagnosis, research suggests that self-compassion
serves as a protective factor against the development of
psychopathology (Trompetter et al., 2016) while promot-
ing creativity, resilience, and self-exploration (Sharma &
Davidson, 2015). Research conducted across various clinical
settings also suggests a significant impact of self-compassion
on overall quality of life. For example, in a study examin-
ing the influence of self-compassion on health-related qual-
ity of life in individuals with multiple sclerosis, researchers
found that engaging in self-compassion significantly pre-
dicted participants’ physical, social, and mental health, as
well as overall life satisfaction (Nery-Hurwit et al., 2017).
Self-compassion has also been shown to be significantly
and negatively related to psychological distress in individuals
with chronic pain (Costa & Pinto-Gouveia, 2013; Sirois
et al., 2015; Wren et al., 2012), social anxiety (Blackie &
Kocovski, 2018), major depressive disorder (Diedrich et al.,
2016), and diabetes (Friis et al. 2016).

Self-Compassion Across Gender

Gender, which may or may not correspond to bio-

logical sex, refers to an individual’s “psychological identifi-
cation with typical societal gender roles” (Yarnell et al.,
2018). In the general population, previous research impli-
cates a potential effect of gender on self-compassion level,
though these findings are mixed. While some research sug-
gests that females tend to seek and sustain more social rela-
tionships (Baker & McNulty, 2011; Hill & Lynch, 1983)
and would thus be more self-compassionate compared to
males, other research suggests that females exhibit greater
rumination and self-criticism compared to males (DeVore,
2013). Recent research, including a meta-analysis (Yarnell
et al., 2015) and replication (Yarnell et al., 2018), indi-
cates that men tend to have slightly higher self-compassion
levels than women, though the effect size is small.

With regard to stuttering, studies indicate that gender
plays a role in males’ and females’ experiences of stutter-
ing. Specifically, empirical research supports the idea that
females who stutter are at unique risk for dual discrimi-
nation as it relates to negative perception of females com-
pared to males who stutter (Byrd et al., 2017). The dual
minority status that females who stutter hold, along with

Downloaded from: https://pubs.asha.org Michigan State University on 11/11/2025, Terms of Use: https://pubs.asha.org/pubs/rights_and_permissions the increased discrimination and stigma that comes along
with these identities, could put females who stutter at in-
creased risk for lower self-compassion compared to males.
Qualitative studies support the idea that gender can

influence the experience of stuttering. In a qualitative study
examining the stuttering experiences of women who stutter,
female participants reported a close, “fused” relationship
between their identities as women and as PWS, as well as
pressures to communicate in a certain way depending on
the context (Nang et al., 2018). These women who stutter
reported that stuttering significantly interfered with their
self-esteem, their confidence, and their ability to form social
relationships with others (Nang et al., 2018). However,
studies in the stuttering literature have not yet explored
potential self-compassion differences.

The Relevance of Self-Compassion
to the Impact of Stuttering

Previous research highlights the intersections between
each tenet of self-compassion—mindfulness, self-kindness,
and common humanity—and the stuttering experience.
Qualitative and quantitative studies support the use of
mindfulness for “observing” moments of stuttering, rather
than judging or overidentifying with them. Doing so can
differentiate a negative stuttering experience from a neutral
one (Beilby et al., 2012; Constantino, 2016; Tichenor &
Yaruss, 2018). Empirical evidence also suggests that mind-
fulness is positively related to quality of life in PWS. Emge
and Pellowski (2019) examined the influence of mindful-
ness meditation on decreasing disfluencies and improving
communication attitude and psychosocial well-being. As
mindfulness increased, the negative impact of stuttering
on quality of life, as indicated by the Overall Assessment
of the Speaker’s Experience of Stuttering (OASES; Yaruss
& Quesal, 2006), decreased. Rather than significant differ-
ences in the stuttering moments themselves, one’s “response”
to such moments matter most for decreasing the negative
impact of stuttering.

Self-kindness is also relevant for adults who stutter,
as anecdotal and empirical evidence suggests that PWS of-
ten face high levels of self-criticism and judgment (Corcoran
& Stewart, 1998; Daniels & Gabel, 2004). This self-criticism
can result in significantly elevated levels of negative mood
states compared to controls on dimensions such as inter-
personal sensitivity, depressive mood, and hostility, regard-
less of stuttering severity, demonstrating the quality of life
consequences of negative internal dialogue (Tran et al.,
2011). Alternatively, positive self-talk (i.e., self-kindness)
has been associated with improved recovery and positive
treatment outcomes (Plexico et al., 2005).

Finally, previous research supports the role that

“common humanity” plays a role in the experience of stut-
tering, as a PWS’s perception of self in relation to others
can either lead to feelings of disconnection and distance or
healing and connection. In their examination of stuttering
and identity, Plexico et al. (2009) found that participants
who stutter had created a fluent speaker–nonfluent speaker

dichotomy, thus distancing self from others. Rather than
focusing on commonalities, PWS identified stuttering as
the key factor that distinguished them from others. Specifi-
cally, participants who stutter viewed the fluent speaker
identity as more desirable than the nonfluent speaker iden-
tity, leading to feelings of low self-esteem, cognitive/affective
discomfort, and reduced self-acceptance. This finding dem-
onstrates how viewing self as separate from others can lead
to feelings that negatively impact well-being. The same
study, however, found that some participants navigated
stuttering-related challenges by acknowledging their pain
as a shared human experience. Doing so led to feelings
of increased connection with others, underscoring the rele-
vance of common humanity.

As indicated, mindfulness, self-kindness, and com-

mon humanity each plays critical roles in the quality of life
of PWS. Examining these components under the broader
construct of self-compassion captures what mindfulness,
self-kindness, and common humanity do not capture inde-
pendently: how adults who stutter respond to and treat
themselves during difficult moments. The construct of mind-
fulness speaks to individuals’ attachment to or distancing
from thoughts or feelings; however, mindfulness alone does
not address the delivery of positive and helpful messages
toward self (i.e., self-kindness) or the ability to relate one’s
experiences to others (i.e., common humanity). Addition-
ally, self-kindness has been discussed generally in the stut-
tering literature in the context of PWS’s internal dialogue
and self-talk (e.g., Gabel et al., 2002; Plexico et al., 2005;
Tran et al., 2011) but has yet to be measured or explicitly
defined. Exploring self-kindness as a subconstruct of self-
compassion expands the literature by quantifying and defin-
ing this practice in the context of stuttering. Finally, while
stuttering research has addressed and emphasized the value
of common humanity, this construct as it relates to self-
compassion in PWS has not been investigated. Thus, it is
unknown if or how PWS use social connectedness to engage
in self-compassionate practices.

Existing treatment approaches, such as acceptance

and commitment therapy (ACT; Beilby et al., 2012), reveal
the value of investigating multidimensional constructs in
the context of stuttering. Just as ACT is composed of six
core processes that contribute to psychological flexibility,
self-compassion contains three components that contribute
to the ability to provide relief during difficult moments.
Just as the “values” and “committed action” components
of ACT would not lead to psychological flexibility on
their own, the mindfulness, self-kindness, and common
humanity do not independently capture self-compassionate
practice.

Examining self-compassion as a cohesive construct

holds implications for reducing the negative impact of stut-
tering. Given the robust research to suggest the relation-
ship between self-compassion and quality of life in other
populations, it is worth exploring this relationship among
adults who stutter. This study will be the first of its kind
to take these three constructs that are composed of fac-
tors that independently do not provide the same information

construct of self-compassion among adults who stutter.

Purpose of This Study

Considering PWS are at unique risk for lower quality

of life compared to people who do not stutter (PWNS)
and given the potential benefit of self-compassion to im-
proving quality of life in PWS, it is worth exploring how
self-compassion relates to quality of life in PWS. Together,
the core principles of self-compassion appear to be impact-
ful for PWS. The purpose of this study was to examine the
relationship between self-compassion and quality of life in
adults who stutter.

Research Questions

The following research questions were addressed:

1.

2.

Do self-compassion levels differ significantly across
male and female adults who do and do not stutter?

Does self-compassion predict the impact of stuttering
on quality of life among adults who stutter?

We hypothesized that both males and females who

stutter would demonstrate significantly lower levels of self-
compassion compared to PWNS. We also hypothesized
that females who stutter would report lower self-compassion
levels compared to males who stutter. Finally, we hypothe-
sized that self-compassion would significantly predict the
impact of stuttering on quality of life, such that as self-
compassion increases, the negative impact of stuttering
would decrease.

Method
Participants

Eligible participants included adults (≥ 18 years old)

who do and do not stutter. Each participant self-identified
as a person who does or does not stutter by answering the
following question: “Stuttering is the repetition of sounds
or words with tension, or a blockage of air and voice dur-
ing speech. People who stutter know what they want to
say, but have trouble getting words out during a stuttering
moment. Are you a person who stutters?” (adapted from
Andrews et al., 1983; Craig et al., 2009). Participants indi-
cated “yes” or “no,” which led them to the appropriate
survey.

Recruitment

Prior to starting recruitment, this study was approved
by the authors’ university institutional review board. To
recruit participants who stutter, the researchers e-mailed
the clinical directors of speech-language pathology pro-
grams across the United States, who were asked to forward
a Qualtrics survey link to eligible participants. Additionally,
speech-language pathologists who specialize in stuttering,
as indicated from the Stuttering Foundation referrals web-
page (https://www.stutteringhelp.org/therapy-referrals),

were contacted via e-mail and asked to forward the survey
to adults who stutter. Participants were also recruited through
the National Stuttering Association e-mail listserv and
social media platform after obtaining approval from the
National Stuttering Association Institutional Review
Board.

After obtaining our participant cohort of adults who

stutter, participants who do not stutter, matched for age
and gender, were recruited through mass e-mail, Facebook
groups unrelated to speech-language pathology, and word
of mouth (i.e., asking undergraduate research assistants
to forward the survey to eligible participants).

Survey

Data were collected via an electronic survey on the
Qualtrics platform. The first page outlined institutional
review board approval, the general purpose, known asso-
ciated risks and benefits, the anonymity of responses, and
the freedom to stop the survey at any time. Participants
indicated their consent by clicking on the “>>” arrows at
the bottom of the page, which led to the start of the survey.
Participants who stutter completed demographic informa-
tion, as well as measures of self-compassion and impact of
stuttering on quality of life. Participants who do not stutter
also completed a demographics questionnaire and a self-
compassion measure. These survey sections were presented
in a randomized order to each participant to prevent order
effects.

Demographics

The demographic section asked all participants to

report age and gender. Participants who stutter were also
asked about previous and current support group and treat-
ment experience, including number of months of current
and/or previous involvement. If the participant was currently
or had previously received treatment for stuttering from a
certified speech-language pathologist, they were asked to
indicate the number of months in treatment and the types
of tasks included in therapy. Tasks were selected from the
following options: techniques to speak fluently; techniques to
release tension during stuttering moments; reducing avoid-
ance; addressing thoughts, feelings and attitudes related to
stuttering; or other (adapted from Yaruss et al., 2002).

The Self-Compassion Scale

Participants who do and do not stutter were required
to complete the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS), a self-report
measure that quantifies emotional and cognitive behav-
iors associated with more versus less self-compassion (Neff,
2003; Neff & Germer, 2017). This scale was selected as it
has been used to examine self-compassion across a variety
of clinical and nonclinical populations and exhibits strong
psychometric properties. Specifically, the scale has demon-
strated high internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = .94; Neff
et al., 2007); good test–retest reliability (r = .93 for overall
score, .88 for Self-Kindness, .88 for Self-Judgment, .80 for
Common Humanity, .85 for Isolation, .85 for Mindfulness,

lidity with social connectedness and resilient coping (e.g.,
Albertson et al., 2014; Breines et al., 2014); and divergent
validity with psychopathology, depression, self-criticism,
and rumination (MacBeth & Gumley, 2012; Neff, 2003,
2011, 2016). It is also the most widely cited measure of self-
compassion to date.

On this 26-item instrument, participants provide

responses on a 1–5 Likert scale. Anchor labels designate
number 1 as almost never and 5 as almost always. Numbers
2–4 are labeled numerically without a qualitative label.
The measure includes six subscales: (a) Self-Kindness (e.g.,
“I try to be loving toward myself when I’m feeling emo-
tional pain”), (b) Self-Judgment (e.g., “I’m disapproving
and judgmental about my own flaws and inadequacies”),
(c) Common Humanity (e.g., “When things are going
badly for me, I see the difficulties as part of life that every-
one goes through”), (d) Isolation (e.g., “When I think
about my inadequacies, it tends to make me feel more sep-
arate and cut off from the rest of the world”), (e) Mind-
fulness (e.g., “When I’m feeling down, I try to approach
my feelings with curiosity and openness”), and (f ) Over-
identification (e.g., “When something upsets me, I get carried
away with my feelings”). Each subscale mean is calculated
by averaging the item responses pertaining to that sub-
scale. Thus, higher subscale means indicate increased thoughts
and behaviors associated with that construct. Before calcu-
lating an overall self-compassion mean, negatively worded
items (i.e., items in the Self-Judgment, Isolation, and Over-
identification subscales) are reverse-scored. Therefore,
a higher total self-compassion score indicates greater
self-compassion.

Impact of Stuttering

To measure the negative impact of stuttering on

daily life, the survey also included the OASES (Yaruss &
Quesal, 2006). This 100-item self-report instrument col-
lects responses on a 1–5 Likert scale. Response options
(e.g., agree–disagree, not at all difficult–extremely difficult)
differ depending on the subsection. The higher the score
between 1 and 5, the greater the negative impact of stut-
tering. Section I, General Information, contains 20 items
that collect information regarding the participant’s knowl-
edge about stuttering, perceived speech fluency and natu-
ralness, and perceptions of treatment and support groups.
Section II, Reactions to Stuttering, contains 30 items that
examine affective, behavioral, and cognitive consequences
of stuttering. Section III, Communication in Daily Situa-
tions, contains 25 items that measure the degree to which
stuttering interferes with communication across diverse
situations, such as with friends, at school, at work, and at
home. Section IV, Quality of Life, contains 25 items that
evaluate the extent to which stuttering negatively impacts
the participant’s satisfaction across various domains, such
as relationships, vocational opportunities, and overall out-
look on life. The OASES has demonstrated high internal
consistency (Cronbach’s α = .90), test–retest reliability
(r = .90–.97; Yaruss & Quesal, 2006), ecological validity

(Franic & Bothe, 2008), and clinical utility (Yaruss & Quesal,
2006, 2010).

Analyses

To examine the predictive and correlational relation-

ship between self-compassion and quality of life in adults
who stutter, simple linear regression and bivariate corre-
lation analyses were used. These analyses were selected to
determine the extent of the linear relationship between self-
compassion and the impact of stuttering on quality of life.
Results from these analyses hold implications for identify-
ing how self-compassion relates to quality of life outcomes
in PWS. The magnitude of each correlation was interpreted
based on Evans’ (1996) framework, which denotes relation-
ships less than .40 as weak, .40–.59 as moderate, and .60 and
higher as strong to very strong. To correct for the multiple
comparisons and to prevent Type I error, a Bonferroni
correction was applied by dividing .05 by the number of
comparisons (i.e., seven). Thus, an alpha value of .007 was
used to interpret significant findings. A two-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) was also conducted to investigate
main effects of gender and stuttering status (i.e., being a
person who does or does not stutter) on self-compassion
levels among adults who do and do not stutter. Interaction
effects between gender and stuttering status were also ex-
amined. This analysis was selected to determine whether
significant mean differences in self-compassion within and
between these groups exist. Results from this analysis con-
tribute to understanding regarding how males and females
who do and do not stutter are similar and different.

Prior to the study, power analyses were conducted in
G* Power to determine a sufficient sample size to prevent
Type II error in each analysis (Faul et al., 2007). For the
two-way ANOVA with four groups (i.e., males, females,
PWS, and PWNS), we used an alpha level of .05, a power
of .90, and a medium-to-large effect size of 0.32. This effect
size was based on previous research citing significant differ-
ences between PWS and PWNS on outcomes related to
social function, emotional function, and mental health, with
effect sizes ranging from 0.32 to 0.59 (Craig et al., 2009)
Results indicated a desired sample size of 127 total partic-
ipants (i.e., at least 64 participants in each group).

For the simple linear regression with one predictor,

we used an alpha level of .05, a power value of .90, and
a medium-to-large effect size of 0.25. This effect size was
based on a preliminary data analysis with 15 participants
that yielded an effect size of 0.258. Results indicated a de-
sired sample size of 45 participants.

Prior to conducting the analyses, the data set was

examined to ensure that assumptions were met and to iden-
tify outliers. Three outliers were identified via a scatter
plot and removed from the data corpus. Linearity, homo-
scedasticity, and normality were assessed using residual
plots and the Shapiro–Wilk test. Residual plots revealed a
random pattern along the horizontal axis, and the Shapiro–
Wilk test indicated a nonsignificant p value of .611, thus
satisfying assumptions of linearity, homoscedasticity, and

comparisons, Levene’s test for the equality of variance was
used to determine whether error variances were equal across
groups. Results indicated nonsignificant p values at the
.05 level for all group comparisons, supporting the assump-
tion of homogeneity of variance. The final participant pool
included 37 male and 33 female adults who stutter, ranging
in age from 18 to 73 years (n = 70 participants who stut-
ter). Participants also included 70 adults who do not stutter
controls matched for age (within 5 years of participants
who stutter) and gender (exact matches). If multiple adults
who do not stutter who matched a participant who stutters
for age and gender completed the survey, the first partici-
pant to complete the survey was included. Both the total
sample size (n = 140) and the sample of adults who stutter
(n = 70) exceeded the minimum sample size required for
the analyses, as indicated by the power analysis. See Table 1
for additional participant demographics.

Results
Comparing Male and Female Adults
Who Do and Do Not Stutter

A 2 (gender) × 2 (PWS or PWNS) ANOVA was per-

formed on self-compassion. There was no significant main

Discussion

This study aimed to identify self-compassion levels

across males and females who do and do not stutter and to
determine whether self-compassion predicts the impact of
stuttering on quality of life in adults who stutter. Find-
ings expand the literature by highlighting self-compassion
as a strategy that plays a role in reducing the negative
impact of stuttering. Specifically, results implicate how
self-compassion could help to reduce adverse reactions to
stuttering, improve participation in daily communication
situations, and improve quality of life.

Self-Compassion Differences Across
PWS and PWNS

(Craig & Tran, 2014; Gabel et al., 2002), emotional reactiv-
ity (Vanryckeghem et al., 2017), and distress (Craig et al.,
2009) compared to adults who do not stutter, results are
contrary to the researchers’ hypothesis that adults who stut-
ter would report significantly lower self-compassion than
adults who do not stutter. However, it is possible that self-
compassion is not the sole driver of these affective and
cognitive differences between adults who do and do not stut-
ter. Other factors, such as self-efficacy (Carter et al., 2019),
resilience (Plexico et al., 2019), degree of self-disclosure
(Boyle et al., 2018), and psychosocial well-being (Boyle,
2015) have also been found to be strongly associated with
quality of life indicators in PWS. Therefore, these others
factors might play a greater role in predicting differences
between PWS and PWNS than self-compassion alone. No
other studies compare self-compassion levels of adults who
do and do not stutter; more research that explores the rela-
tionship between self-compassion, other confounding fac-
tors (e.g., self-efficacy, resilience) and quality of life in both
adults who do and do not stutter would yield further in-
sight regarding the contribution of these relative factors to
disparate quality of life outcomes.

Second, it is important to note that 34% of the sample

was involved in a support group at the time of the study,
with an additional 42% reporting previous support group
involvement. Twenty-five percent were also enrolled in
treatment at the time of participation, with an additional
64% reporting previous enrollment. Previous research sug-
gests that individuals with higher self-compassion are more
likely to engage in help-seeking behaviors than individuals
with low self-compassion, which ultimately reduces self-
stigma and increases social support (Heath et al., 2017).
Thus, it is possible that, as a whole, this cohort of adults
who stutter was more self-compassionate than the broader
population of adults who stutter.

Total self-compassion scores did not differ signifi-
cantly across adults who do and do not stutter. Thus, re-
sults suggest that adults who stutter experience a similar
level of self-compassion to the general population. Given
that adults who stutter historically report increased anxiety

Self-Compassion and Gender

Results revealed no significant differences in self-
compassion between males and females who stutter, thus
rejecting the authors’ hypothesis that females who stutter
would be significantly less self-compassionate than males.

Downloaded from: https://pubs.asha.org Michigan State University on 11/11/2025, Terms of Use: https://pubs.asha.org/pubs/rights_and_permissions Results from this study also did not find a significant inter-
action between gender and stuttering status (i.e., being a
person who does or does not stutter). Namely, females
who do and do not stutter exhibited similar levels of self-
compassion, as did males who do and do not stutter. While
previous research highlights the lower levels of self-esteem
(Nang et al., 2018) and dual discrimination (Byrd et al.,
2017) that women who stutter face, which could be asso-
ciated with lower self-compassion, a study by Klein and
Hood (2004) found that women were less likely to report
that stuttering interfered with their employability and job
performance. Thus, results from the current study suggest
that, despite the increased challenges that women who stut-
ter may endure, females and males who stutter respond to
feelings of inadequacy with similar levels of mindful aware-
ness, self-kindness, and relatedness to others. This finding
also aligns with previous research citing no significant
self-compassion differences between males and females
(Berryhill et al., 2018; Iksender, 2009; Neff et al., 2007).

Self-Compassion and Quality of Life Implications
for Adults Who Stutter

Results indicated that higher levels of self-compassion

predict a lesser negative impact of stuttering on quality
of life among adults who stutter, confirming the authors’
hypothesis. Specifically, increasing self-kindness, mindful-
ness, and social connectedness and decreasing self-judgment,
overidentification, and isolation are associated with reduced
negative reactions to stuttering, increased participation in
daily communication situations, and reduced impact of
stuttering on overall quality of life. These results reinforce
previous research that supports the potential benefits of
mindfulness, self-kindness, and social connectedness for
increasing positive outcomes, such as reducing rumina-
tion, increasing positive affect, and promoting resiliency
among adults who stutter (Boyle, 2013; Plexico et al., 2009;
Yaruss et al., 2002). Findings broaden the evidence base
by analyzing these components as a cohesive construct (i.e.,
self-compassion), establishing the predictive self-compassion-
quality of life relationship, and identifying the relative
strength of the relationship between each Self-Compassion
subscale and total as well as each OASES subscale and
total.

The correlational analyses revealed particularly strong
relationships between Isolation and Reactions to Stuttering,
Isolation and OASES total, and Self-Judgment and OASES
Total. The Isolation subscale refers to the degree to which
an individual feels separate and cutoff from others when
experiencing feelings of inadequacy, suggesting that when
adults who stutter feel secluded and isolated during diffi-
cult times, they are also more likely to experience feelings
such as anxiety, depression, and embarrassment related to
stuttering. Each of these reactions to stuttering can nega-
tively impact quality of life. The Self-Judgment subscale
refers to an individual’s tendency to view perceived flaws
through a lens of criticism and judgment, rather than kind-
ness and acceptance. Thus, results suggest that as adults

who stutter judge their perceived inadequacies harshly and
critically; they are also more likely to report a greater inter-
ference of stuttering with their overall quality of life.

These findings must be considered in the context of

other potential moderators of the self-compassion–quality
of life relationship. As mentioned, previous research high-
lights a variety of factors that could affect quality of life in
PWS, including self-efficacy (Carter et al., 2019), self-stigma
(Boyle, 2018), resilience (Plexico et al., 2019), degree of
self-disclosure (Boyle et al., 2018), and psychosocial well-
being (Boyle, 2015). Beyond the stuttering literature, studies
conducted in other populations suggest that level of educa-
tion (López et al., 2018) and overall mental well-being
(Durkin et al., 2016) are associated with self-compassion
levels and associated quality of life outcomes. Given the
potential influence of these other variables on the self-
compassion and quality of life relationship, results from
this study cannot assert a definite, causal relationship be-
tween self-compassion and quality of life in adults who
stutter. Rather, results suggest that self-compassion may
play a role in reducing the negative impact of stuttering.

Clinical Implications

There are existing treatment methods that address

aspects of self-compassion, such as mindfulness intervention
(Emge & Pellowski, 2019), ACT (Beilby et al., 2012), and
cognitive–behavioral therapy (Amster & Klein, 2018). These
approaches overlap with self-compassion in their mindful
awareness (mindfulness intervention and cognitive–behavioral
therapy) and/or acceptance of thoughts and feelings (ACT).
However, self-compassion differs from these approaches in
its use of mindful awareness to channel supportive messages
inward, its emphasis on social connectedness, and its pri-
mary purpose to provide relief to self before, during, and
after difficult moments (Germer & Neff, 2013). Aspects
of mindfulness, self-kindness, and common humanity have
been incorporated into previously investigated treatment
approaches but have yet to be explored as the cohesive
construct of self-compassion. While empirical and anec-
dotal evidence explicitly “describe” the value of addressing
self-compassion in stuttering treatment (e.g., Harley, 2018;
Hudock et al., 2017), results from this study provide empiri-
cal support to address specific components of self-compassion
in a more direct, intentional manner in the clinical setting.
Specifically, self-compassion is a tool that could be used in
the clinical setting to help decrease the negative impact
of stuttering on quality of life. Further research is needed
before specific intervention methods are suggested. Still,
clinicians should be aware that integrating practices of mind-
fulness, self-kindness, and increased social connectedness
could help reduce negative feelings such as shame, embar-
rassment, and anxiety related to stuttering and improve
overall life satisfaction. By incorporating self-compassion
conceptually and functionally, adults who stutter could
increase their awareness of negative reactions, gain self-
soothing skills, and view their experience in a balanced
perspective. Practically, adults who stutter could practice

arise (e.g., “everyone at work thinks you are incompetent
because you stutter”), reducing overidentification or rumi-
nation on these thoughts and using language that commu-
nicates concern and comfort to self (e.g., “you are doing
the best you can, and people at work seem to really respect
you”).

Self-compassion could also function as a companion
to existing treatment methods, such as voluntary stuttering
and self-disclosure. These evidence-based desensitization
and stigma reduction techniques, both of which can lead
to decreased avoidance and increased positive perceptions
(Boyle et al., 2018; Byrd et al., 2017, 2016), often require
adults who stutter to persist through a reportedly difficult
adjustment period before the technique becomes effective.
For example, in Byrd et al.’s (2016) study, 42% and 30% of
participants were uncomfortable or somewhat uncomfort-
able using voluntary stuttering at first, and one in five par-
ticipants had never voluntary stuttered outside the room.
Additionally, anecdotal evidence indicates that PWS often
report “failure” to use a given technique when they “should”
have, reflecting a degree of self-judgment even in the con-
text of a strategy intended to decrease negative attitudes.
Thus, the benefits of these strategies, which come with in-
creased exposure and practice, may never be experienced
by a PWS whose feelings of self-criticism dominate the ex-
perience. Given the robust research to suggest that indi-
viduals who score high in self-compassion recover more
quickly following perceived failure (Neff & McGeehee,
2010), it is possible that integrating self-compassion in the
clinical setting could help adults who stutter experience a
treatment process characterized by reduced self-judgment,
increased support, and ultimately, enhanced quality of life.

Additional Considerations

Results should be interpreted under the notion that
this cohort of adults who stutter may not represent the
broader population of adults who stutter. A larger sample
size would allow for an increase in power, a reduced likeli-
hood of Type II error, and more meaningful interpretation
of results. Additionally, given the high rate of support group
and treatment enrollment in the sample used in this study,
this group of adults who stutter could be significantly more
self-compassionate than the general population. Future
research should engage adults who stutter who are not
enrolled in a support group or treatment to gain a more
representative sample of the stuttering population. More
research is needed to replicate or to challenge current find-
ings. Additionally, while there were not enough participants
in the current study to compare self-compassion levels of
participants with current/previous support group involve-
ment to those with no support group involvement, the
authors will examine this research question in a future study
with an increased number of participants.

Importantly, interpretation of results should consider

moderating factors of the self-compassion–quality of life
relationship, such as self-acceptance, self-efficacy, resilience,

and locus of control. Given that previous research links
these factors to quality of life, the relationship between these
variables and self-compassion should be established. More-
over, while theory supports the idea that self-compassion
influences variability in quality of life, the design of this
study does not rule out the possibility of reverse direction-
ality. It is possible that variations in a PWS’s reactions to
stuttering, participation in communication situations, and
life satisfaction could predict differences in self-compassion.
The directionality of this relationship should be investigated
in future research. Additionally, the role of self-compassion
as a moderator between stuttering severity and quality of
life should also be explored. Finally, interventions to culti-
vate self-compassion in and out of the clinical setting should
be investigated and developed.

Conclusions

This study sought to identify self-compassion levels
across people who do and do not stutter and to determine
the relationship between self-compassion and quality of life
in PWS. Total self-compassion scores did not differ signifi-
cantly across males and females who do and do not stutter,
suggesting similar levels of mindfulness, self-kindness, and
social connectedness in these population samples. This study
should be replicated in future research to see if similar re-
sults are obtained. While previous research indicates that
PWS are at risk for self-stigma, increased distress, and
reduced life satisfaction, the current study provides evidence
that self-compassion is associated with a reduction of these
negative, quality of life consequences. Incorporating prac-
tices of mindfulness versus overidentification, self-kindness
versus self-judgment, and common humanity versus iso-
lation could help adults who stutter decrease negative
communication attitudes, increase participation in daily
communication situations, and improve overall quality
of life.
