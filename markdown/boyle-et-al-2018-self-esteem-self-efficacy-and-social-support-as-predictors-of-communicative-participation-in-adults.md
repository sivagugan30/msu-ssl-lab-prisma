Self-Esteem, Self-Efficacy, and Social
Support as Predictors of Communicative
Participation in Adults Who Stutter

Michael P. Boyle,a Carolina Beita-Ell,a Kathryn M. Milewski,a and Alison N. Fearona

Purpose: This study aimed to identify contributors to
communicative participation in adults who stutter.
Specifically, it was of interest to determine whether
psychosocial variables of self-esteem, self-efficacy,
and social support were predictive of communicative
participation beyond contributions of demographic and
speech-related variables.
Method: Adults who stutter (N = 339) completed an
online survey that included measures of communicative
participation, self-esteem, self-efficacy, social support,
self-reported speech-related variables (speech usage,
number of years stuttering, history of treatment and self-
help support group participation for stuttering, and physical
speech disruption severity), and demographics (age, sex,
living situation, education, and employment status).
Hierarchical regression was performed for prediction of
communicative participation, in addition to calculating
Spearman correlations between social roles variables,

communicative participation, and physical speech disruption
severity.
Results: After controlling for demographic and speech-related
variables, self-esteem, self-efficacy, and social support each
significantly predicted communicative participation in adults
who stutter. Large correlations were observed between
communicative participation and measures of social roles,
whereas medium correlations were observed between
physical speech disruption severity and measures of social
roles.
Conclusions: Communicative participation in adults who
stutter is associated with a variety of demographic, speech-
related, and psychosocial variables. Speech-language
pathologists should be aware of predictors of communicative
participation such as self-esteem, self-efficacy, and social
support, in addition to severity of physical speech disruptions.
They should consider and evaluate these factors in clients
who stutter and target them in treatment if necessary.

R ecognizing that health conditions and outcomes

are inextricably linked with multiple factors aside
from physical impairments, the World Health

Organization developed the International Classification of
Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). The ICF is a
biopsychosocial classification system in which “functioning
and disability is conceived as a dynamic interaction between
health conditions (diseases, disorders, injuries, trauma, etc.)
and contextual factors” (World Health Organization, 2001,
p. 8). The ICF discusses several components related to a
health condition: body functions and structures, activity
and participation, environmental factors, and personal
factors. The stuttering literature to date provides little

documentation of communicative participation in adults
who stutter using validated and focused tools. This study
sought to examine this topic and analyze the variables of
self-esteem, self-efficacy, and social support as predictors
of communicative participation in adults who stutter. This
introduction will discuss the importance of communicative
participation in the field of speech-language pathology, the
impact of stuttering on communicative participation, and
variables that are hypothesized to predict communicative
participation in people who stutter (PWS).

Communicative Participation and Its Applications
to Speech-Language Pathology

Communicative participation can be defined as “taking
part in life situations where knowledge, information, ideas,
or feelings are exchanged” (Eadie et al., 2006, p. 309). Ex-
amining variables like communicative participation within
the ICF framework is critical for speech-language patholo-
gists’ (SLPs) ability to provide adequate services. The

with it can strongly affect an individual’s level of commu-
nicative participation (Eadie et al., 2006). Reduced com-
municative participation may result in negative consequences
including social isolation, loss of employment, and/or diffi-
culty in accessing health care and other services (Eadie et al.,
2006). Reduced communicative participation would also be
expected to negatively impact individuals’ ability to fulfill
their social roles and their satisfaction with those roles
(Yorkston, Baylor, & Amtmann, 2014). The ICF can help
SLPs gain a deeper understanding of the impact of a com-
munication disorder on an individual and provides a frame-
work for identifying relevant assessment strategies and
treatment targets (Eadie, 2001). For example, in assessment
of a client with a voice disorder, investigating the function of
the vocal folds would be supplemented with information re-
garding how the client perceives his or her communication
disorder, how the disorder affects daily activities, and how
others in the client’s environment perceive the disorder.

The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association
(ASHA, 2016) scope of practice utilizes the ICF framework
for describing the roles of the SLP. Despite ASHA adopt-
ing the ICF, research has shown that it is rarely used by
clinicians and uncommon to find outside of a university
setting due to limited tools measuring ICF variables (Ma,
Threats, & Worrall, 2008), in addition to time and produc-
tivity constraints, limitations in the controlled clinical setting
itself, and documentation challenges (Torrence, Baylor,
Yorkston, & Spencer, 2016). To address the issue of lim-
ited tools that evaluate communicative participation, a se-
ries of qualitative studies involving individuals with multiple
sclerosis, spasmodic dysphonia, stuttering, stroke, Parkinson’s
disease, laryngectomy, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(Baylor, Burns, Eadie, Britton, & Yorkston, 2011; Baylor,
Yorkston, Eadie, Miller, & Amtmann, 2009; Yorkston et al.,
2007, 2008) was conducted to generate and refine items to
be included in the Communicative Participation Item Bank
(CPIB; Baylor et al., 2013). The CPIB ultimately contained
46 items, and a 10-item short form was also developed that
could be used in research and clinical settings (Baylor et al.,
2013). There was good reliability demonstrated between
the 46-item bank and the 10-item form (Baylor et al., 2013).
The CPIB has been used in several quantitative stud-

ies with different populations, and findings suggest that
communicative participation is associated with multiple
factors beyond physical impairment (Baylor et al., 2011;
Baylor, Yorkston, Bamer, Britton, & Amtmann, 2010; Bolt,
Eadie, Yorkston, Baylor, & Amtmann, 2016; Ward,
Jarman, Cornwell, & Amsters, 2016; Yorkston, Baylor, &
Mach, 2017). For example, restricted communicative partici-
pation in adults with multiple sclerosis was associated with
lower level of speech usage, higher levels of education, prob-
lems in cognitive communication function, lower levels of
physical abilities, and more severe speech symptoms
(Yorkston et al., 2014). In individuals with Parkinson’s dis-
ease, perceived level of impairment was the strongest pre-
dictor of lessened participation, suggesting individuals’
beliefs about their disorders may be more impactful on

participation than physical limitations caused by their dis-
orders (McAuliffe, Baylor, & Yorkston, 2017).

The Potential Impact of Stuttering
on Communicative Participation

The impact of stuttering on communicative partici-
pation has been examined extensively in previous research
involving qualitative content analysis and questionnaires
that included items evaluating participation restrictions ex-
perienced by PWS (Boyle, 2013b, 2015; Craig, Blumgart,
& Tran, 2009; Plexico, Manning, & Levitt, 2009a, 2009b).
However, it should be clarified that no previous research
in this area has used the CPIB or its short form, discussed
in the previous section, to evaluate the construct of com-
municative participation in adults who stutter. Although
attitudinal scales in the area of stuttering such as the Over-
all Assessment of the Speaker’s Experience of Stuttering
(Yaruss & Quesal, 2006), the Unhelpful Thoughts and
Beliefs About Stuttering (UTBAS; St. Clare et al., 2009),
and the Self-Stigma of Stuttering Scale (Boyle, 2013a)
contain items that tap into the construct of communicative
participation, they are bundled together with other con-
structs, making focused measurement of communicative
participation challenging.

Research suggests that many PWS develop a fear

and avoidance of social situations that require them
to verbally express themselves (Bricker-Katz, Lincoln, &
Cumming, 2013; Bricker-Katz, Lincoln, & McCabe, 2010;
Erickson & Block, 2013). The impact of stuttering on
communicative participation occurs across the life span,
from childhood and adolescence into early and late adulthood.
Erickson and Block (2013) found that the ability of ado-
lescents to communicate effectively in daily activities that
involved speaking was significantly impacted by their self-
perceived competence and apprehension in the area of
communication. Bricker-Katz et al. (2013) found that the
pressures and communication demands of the workplace
on adults who stutter led to feelings of self-doubt, limited
communication in response to fear of stuttering, refusal
of promotions, and anticipated negative evaluation from
others. Bricker-Katz et al. (2010) found that many older
individuals who stutter continued to experience negative
impacts later in life, including a fear of speaking that re-
sulted in limitations in participation. It is likely that these
limitations and restrictions negatively impact the ability of
PWS to fulfill certain social roles and their satisfaction in
those roles.

Some previous research studies have shown that PWS
exhibit significantly elevated levels of anxiety, distress, and
negative affect compared to fluent controls (Craig, Blumgart,
& Tran, 2015; Tran, Blumgart, & Craig, 2011). It is possible
that negative emotions experienced by some PWS (e.g.,
anger, frustration, embarrassment, alienation, depression)
could be linked to failed attempts to communicate or avoid-
ance of social penalties resulting from stuttering (Iverach,
Rapee, Wong, & Lowe, 2017; Tran et al., 2011). The use of
safety behaviors (avoiding certain words, decreasing overall

minimize negative feedback received from the public (Iverach
& Rapee, 2014; Lowe et al., 2017). The use of such safety
behaviors as coping strategies has been found to result in
decreased communicative participation in PWS (Plexico et al.,
2009a, 2009b). Many PWS attempt to conceal their stutter-
ing from listeners altogether (Butler, 2013; Constantino,
Manning, & Nordstrom, 2017). If total concealment is not
possible, PWS often try to minimize the frequency and ex-
tent of their outward stuttering (Plexico et al., 2009a). These
avoidances and safety behaviors typically would be expected
to reduce overall communicative participation. Because the
literature indicates that PWS are at risk for reduced com-
municative participation, it is important to examine po-
tential variables that would have the ability to predict
communicative participation in PWS. Previous research
has identified both psychosocial and physical variables
that may be relevant for communicative participation.

Variables Potentially Relevant for Communicative
Participation in PWS

“Self-esteem” is one variable that could be related
to communicative participation. Self-esteem refers to an
individual’s assessment of self-regard, self-worth, and self-
competence that is stable and relatively invariable over time
and across contexts (Coopersmith, 1967; Rosenberg, 1965).
Children, adolescents, and adults who stutter have not re-
ported their self-esteem as significantly lower than norma-
tive data (Blood, Blood, Tellis, & Gabel, 2003; Yovetich,
Leschied, & Flicht, 2000). Boyle (2013b) found that self-
esteem in adults who stutter was comparable to normative
data, even though PWS clearly live with a condition that
is thought to be stigmatized (St. Louis, 2015). In addition,
Boyle (2015) found that higher ratings of self-esteem were
related to increased overall quality of life in adults who
stutter. Research has also shown that increased self-esteem
is significantly associated with reduced feelings of self-stigma
among adults who stutter (Boyle, 2013a). Therefore, it
could be the case that higher self-esteem is a protective factor
in a person’s willingness to communicate and might therefore
be linked to communicative participation.

“Self-efficacy” is another variable that is expected

to predict communicative participation in PWS. Self-efficacy
refers to a person’s self-perceived ability to successfully per-
form a particular task or behavior (Bandura, 1986). Although
self-efficacy beliefs can be domain specific, they coexist and
are presumed to work together to influence psychosocial
outcomes (Caprara, Steca, Cervone, & Artistico, 2003). Self-
efficacy has been proposed to offer some protections against
the pervasive effects of chronic stuttering in PWS (Boyle,
2013b; Craig, Blumgart, & Tran, 2011). Craig et al. (2011)
found that self-efficacy was the strongest predictor for psy-
chological resilience (i.e., the ability to adjust and cope in
the face of challenges and stressors) demonstrated by PWS.
In a longitudinal study, Craig et al. (2015) found that in-
creased self-efficacy explained a significant amount of vari-
ance in positive mood changes of PWS over time. Boyle

(2015) found that self-efficacy was a significant predictor
of quality of life in adults who stutter, above and beyond
physical speech disruption severity. Recent research has
supported the notion that self-efficacy is related to increased
quality of life in PWS (Carter, Breen, Yaruss, & Beilby,
2017). Boyle (2013a) also found that increased self-efficacy
was significantly related to reduced levels of self-stigma in
adults who stutter. Interestingly, as a group, PWS have
reported higher levels of general self-efficacy than norma-
tive data for adults who do not stutter (Boyle, 2013b). From
this literature, therefore, it is reasonable to suspect that self-
efficacy could be an important factor that contributes to
the communicative participation of PWS.

“Social support” is another variable that is expected
to be related to communicative participation. Social support
is said to encompass the intangible (informational or emo-
tional support) and tangible (physical or financial aid) re-
sources afforded by social relationships (Cohen & Hoberman,
1983; Heitzmann & Kaplan, 1988). It has also been deter-
mined to be an important buffer to psychosocial stressors
(Pearson, 1986). Increased social support has been identified
as a predictor of quality of life (Boyle, 2015) and psycho-
logical resilience (Craig et al., 2011) in adults who stutter,
whereas low perceived social support is associated with
increased negative affect in adults who stutter (Blumgart,
Tran, & Craig, 2014; Craig et al., 2015). In addition, self-
help/support group participation has been linked to positive
psychological outcomes including reduced self-stigma and
increased self-efficacy and self-esteem (Boyle, 2015). Unfor-
tunately, PWS as a group have reported lower levels of
self-perceived social support compared to fluent controls
(Blumgart et al., 2014). It is likely, therefore, that social
support is relevant for the communicative participation of
adults who stutter.

In addition to psychosocial variables, the severity of
physical speech disruption demonstrated by PWS is relevant
to consider in its ability to predict communicative partici-
pation. Boyle (2015) found that increased levels of self-rated
speech disruption severity were significantly associated with
reduced quality of life in adults who stutter. In addition, in-
creased stuttering severity has been shown to predict a more
negative impact of stuttering on a person’s life (Iverach, Lowe,
et al., 2017). However, other studies have not found signifi-
cant associations between stuttering severity and psychosocial
outcomes. For example, Craig et al. (2009) found that stut-
tering severity was not significantly associated with any do-
main of quality of life (although emotional health was slightly
reduced for individuals with increased stuttering severity).
Manning and Beck (2013) did not find significant correla-
tions between stuttering severity and psychological variables
including anxiety, social anxiety, or depression. One expla-
nation for the discrepancies between studies is the measure
of stuttering severity used. Boyle (2015) and Iverach, Lowe,
et al. (2017) utilized self-rating scales, whereas the other studies
used percentage of syllables stuttered to measure severity
of speech disruption. Therefore, although past results are
equivocal, it is possible that physical stuttering severity is re-
lated to communicative participation in adults who stutter.

Taken altogether, the review above suggests that
evaluating communicative participation with scientifically
validated scales such as the CPIB is important and relevant
for the scope of practice of clinicians and researchers
working with individuals with communication disorders.
Still, investigation of communicative participation using
dedicated and focused scales such as the CPIB has not been
conducted to date with a large sample of adults who stut-
ter. Furthermore, predictors of communicative participation
in PWS are not well known. It was of interest in this study
to determine predictors of communicative participation in
PWS. Specifically, we were focused on determining whether
variables of self-esteem, self-efficacy, and social support were
predictive of communicative participation beyond the
contributions of demographic and speech-related variables
(e.g., severity of physical speech disruption). A secondary
purpose of the study was to analyze how social roles abil-
ity and social roles satisfaction correlated with communica-
tive participation and physical speech disruption severity in
PWS. Based on previous findings (Yorkston et al., 2014),
it was hypothesized that psychosocial variables of self-
esteem, self-efficacy, and social support would be predic-
tive of communicative participation above and beyond
contributions made by demographic and speech-related
variables. It was also hypothesized that social roles ability
and satisfaction would be more strongly related to commu-
nicative participation than physical speech disruption sever-
ity. The results of these analyses could help to identify
PWS who are at risk for communication restrictions and
indicate potential therapy targets that would help alleviate
those restrictions.

Method
Participants

The data in this study come from 339 adults who

stutter. Participants in this study were recruited from Board
Certified Specialists in Fluency Disorders, SLPs advertised
as having an interest in stuttering via the Stuttering Founda-
tion website, and self-help support group leaders of adult
chapters of the National Stuttering Association in the United
States. Contact information from these professionals and
support group leaders was obtained from public websites.
These individuals were sent an e-mail requesting them to
forward the survey link to clients, group members, or other
acquaintances who stutter. The e-mails were sent three
different times, with 1 week separating each contact, to maxi-
mize response rate. Also, the link to the survey was posted
on several ASHA Community Sites with a request to share
the survey. Participants were included in the study if they
were age 18 or older and confirmed that they stutter. It should
be noted that there were five participants reporting having
stuttered for 5 years or fewer and 10 reporting having stut-
tered for 9 years or fewer. This indicates that these individuals
had a later age of onset than is typically observed. These in-
dividuals were included in the analysis, however, because

there is no evidence to date suggesting that years of stuttering
is an important predictor of self-esteem, self-efficacy, or
social support. In addition, previous research has found no
differences in self-esteem, self-efficacy, or social support across
different age groups of PWS (Boyle, 2015), and therefore,
the inclusion of these individuals with a later age of onset
and fewer years stuttering was not expected to bias the results.
Although records indicated that 533 individuals opened the
survey link, 194 of those individuals were excluded because
they did not meet the inclusion criteria above or did not
complete a sufficient amount of each scale of interest. Only
participants who completed at least 70% of the items in the
scales of interest were included in the various data analyses
(i.e., no more than three items in a 10-item scale could
be missing when calculating averages; Schwarzer, 2005).
This resulted in a final sample size of 339 adults who
stutter.

A summary of participants’ demographic information
can be seen in Table 1. The age of the participants ranged
from 18 to 87 years, although most were young adults, and
number of years stuttering ranged from 1 to 85 years. There
were more men than women, and the sample was primarily
made of individuals identifying as Caucasian. Most partici-
pants had experience attending therapy for stuttering as
well as participating in self-help support groups for stuttering.
Regarding living situation, most of the participants reported

Measures
Communicative Participation

Communicative participation was measured using
the CPIB Short Form (Baylor et al., 2013). This scale is
designed to measure the extent to which the condition (in
this case stuttering) interferes with participation (e.g., ex-
pressing knowledge, information, ideas, or feelings; Baylor
et al., 2013). Importantly, this interference can be due to
impaired ability, psychological, or contextual factors. The
short form is a 10-item form based on the original 46-item
bank, with questions such as “Does your condition interfere
with communicating when you need to say something
quickly?” and “Does your condition interfere with asking
questions in a conversation?” Response options on the
short form range from 3 (not at all ) to 0 (very much), with
a possible total summary score ranging from 0 to 30. Higher
scores are more favorable and indicate more communicative
participation. Baylor et al. (2013) recommended converting
the total summary scores to a logit scale or translation of
scores into T scores. The recommendation for this scoring
conversion was made because the logit scale better approx-
imates equal intervals, allowing for more valid mathematical
operations. Also, valid comparisons across different item
sets would be possible with this conversion. In this study,
T scores were used. These T scores range from 24.20 (indi-
cating the most interference possible) to 71 (indicating no
interference), with mean of 50 and standard deviation of
10 based on the calibration sample used to validate the
item bank (Baylor et al., 2013). The psychometric proper-
ties of the scale including evidence of reliability and valid-
ity of the items are described in an article by Baylor et al.
(2013).

Self-Esteem

Three items representing the construct of self-esteem
were selected from the “self-esteem” section of the Empow-
erment Scale (Rogers, Chamberlin, Ellison, & Crean, 1997).
These items intend to measure how participants feel about
themselves and their sense of personal self-worth. Items
included “I have a positive attitude toward myself,” “I feel
I am a person of worth, at least on equal basis with others,”
and “I feel I have a number of good qualities.” Response
options for each question range from 1 (strongly disagree)
to 4 (strongly agree). Scores were averaged and can range
from 1 to 4, with higher scores representing greater self-
esteem. It should be noted that the Empowerment Scale
was not given in its entirety because many items in the scale
measure different constructs beyond self-esteem, including
righteous anger, community activism, and optimism. Because
only self-esteem was of interest in this study, only the items
measuring self-esteem were utilized. The previous reports

of good reliability of items in the overall scale (α = .86;
Rogers et al., 1997) could not be assumed for the selected
items used in the current study and therefore had to be
established (see Results section).

Self-Efficacy

Self-efficacy was measured with the General Self-
Efficacy Scale Short Form (Romppel et al., 2013). This
scale intends to measure the extent to which individuals
feel that they can control environmental challenges and
demands by taking action. Although self-efficacy is often
thought of as domain specific, this scale measures the
general construct of confidence in the ability to handle
difficult situations. For example, scale items ask for partici-
pants’ perceptions of their own resourcefulness and ability
to handle unexpected events and circumstances. Scores
were averaged and can range from 1 (not at all true) to
4 (exactly true), with higher scores representing greater
self-efficacy. Internal consistency of the items in the scale
has been adequate to good in previous research (α ranging
from .79 to .88), and construct validity has been supported
by the scale’s negative association with symptoms of de-
pression and anxiety and positive association with social
support and mental health (Romppel et al., 2013).

Social Support

Perceived social support was measured with three

items from the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social
Support (Zimet, Dahlem, Zimet, & Farley, 1988). This
group of items spanned across different domains measured
in the scale that gauge perceived level of social support
(e.g., receiving help and emotional support, sharing feelings,
etc.) from significant others, family members, and friends.
We chose one item from each domain (i.e., significant other,
family, friends) that had the strongest correlation to the
overall summary score of the scale. Scores were averaged
across the three items and range from 1 (very strongly
disagree) to 7 (very strongly agree). The average of these
three items correlates very highly (r = .98) with the average
obtained for the overall scale (Boyle, 2015) and therefore
supports the notion that these three items could be used reli-
ably to approximate results from the full scale. Internal reli-
ability for scale items has been reported as high (α ranging
between .85 and .91), and test–retest reliability has been
strong (r coefficients between .72 and .85; Zimet et al., 1988).
Construct validity of the scale is supported through its
significant negative correlations with depression and anxi-
ety (Zimet et al., 1988). Because this study utilized only a
subset of items from the original scale, the authors ana-
lyzed the reliability of these items (see Results section).

Physical Speech Disruption

Severity of physical speech disruption was ascertained
through self-report measures that have been widely used in
the stuttering literature with good reliability (i.e., high inter-
and intrajudge agreement on ratings and strong correlation
with percentage of syllables stuttered; O’Brian, Jones,
Packman, Menzies, & Onslow, 2011; O’Brian, Packman,

Boyle et al.: Communicative Participation in Stuttering 1897

Downloaded from: https://pubs.asha.org Michigan State University on 11/10/2025, Terms of Use: https://pubs.asha.org/pubs/rights_and_permissions & Onslow, 2004). Participants were asked to rate their
typical stuttering severity across eight different speaking
situations (e.g., talking in front of a group of people, talking
to a stranger, talking on the phone). In addition, the authors
modified the instructions to specify that stuttering severity
in this case referred to “the level of physical disruption in
your speech (such as repetitions of sounds, syllables, or words;
prolongations of sounds; and blocks in which the air and
voice stops unexpectedly), tension, effort, or physical move-
ments, that you think are noticeable on the surface for the
majority of the day. It does not refer to the impact of the
disorder as a whole on your life.” This description was added
so that participants focused on the physical domain of their
stuttering only. This was important because the construct
of interest was physical speech disruption severity. Response
options range from 1 (no stuttering) to 9 (extremely severe
stuttering), with higher scores representing more severe
speech disruption. Because physical speech disruption also
includes length of disfluencies (Riley, 2009), participants
were asked how they would rate the duration of their longest
stuttering moments for the majority of the day. Response
options for this item ranged from 1 (less than half a second)
to 9 (1 min or more) with labeled increments of increasing
amounts of time in between those extremes. Participants’
duration of disfluencies score was added to their average
score for the eight items described previously to reflect a
composite score of physical speech disruption severity. This
composite score included self-perceived severity of disfluen-
cies, tension, effort, secondary features, as well as duration
of disfluencies, resulting in possible scores of 2–18 with
higher scores representing more severe physical speech disrup-
tion. The inclusion of duration of disfluencies in the assess-
ment of stuttering reflects previous research recommending
that length of disfluencies be integrated into severity scores
(e.g., weighted measures of stuttering indices; Ambrose &
Yairi, 1999). It should be noted that duration of physical
speech disruption has been previously integrated into severity
measures specific to clinician-rated speech sample analysis
(e.g., Ambrose & Yairi, 1999; Riley, 2009). To our knowl-
edge, this is the first time a self-rated measure of duration
has been integrated into a self-report measure of physical
speech disruption severity.

Speech Usage

The Levels of Use Speech Rating Scale (Baylor,

Yorkston, Eadie, Miller, & Amtmann, 2008) was admin-
istered to determine participants’ perceptions of the typical
speech demands that they face in their everyday life. Partic-
ipants were able to describe speaking demands as undemand-
ing, intermittent, routine, extensive, or extraordinary.
Definitions of each category were provided to participants.

Social Roles

Two questions from the PROMIS Global Health

Questionnaire (Hays, Bjorner, Revicki, Spritzer, & Cella,
2009) assessed participants’ perceptions of social roles abil-
ity (“In general, please rate how well you carry out your
usual social activities and roles—This includes activities at

home, at work and in your community, and responsibilities
as a parent, child, spouse, employee, friend, etc.”) and
social roles satisfaction (“In general, how would you rate
your satisfaction with your social activities and relation-
ships”).1 Response options for both items range from
1 ( poor) to 5 (excellent), with higher scores representing
better social roles abilities and satisfaction. It should be
noted that these two items were reported separately and
were not averaged together.

Demographic Variables

Demographic information collected from partici-
pants that was included in statistical analyses included age,
sex, living situation (dichotomized by living alone or with
at least one other person), employment status (dichoto-
mized by being employed for wages or not), and education
level (dichotomized by obtaining a degree in higher educa-
tion or not), years of stuttering, history of attending stut-
tering therapy, and history of attending self-help support
groups for stuttering.

Procedure

This study employed anonymous web survey method-

ology using Qualtrics Survey Research Software (Qualtrics,
2017). Web surveys have the benefit of being able to reach
participants in various regions of the country without per-
sonally identifying information attached to responses. The
study utilized a cross-sectional design with a combination
of convenience sampling and snowball sampling in order
to maximize the sample size. The study was approved by
the authors’ institutional review board as well as the National
Stuttering Association Research Committee before partici-
pants were recruited. After reading an overview of the study
and implied consent form that described the voluntary and
anonymous nature of the survey, participants completed
the scales described above. Data were collected over approx-
imately a 3-month period from January to April 2017.
Participants in this research study were a part of a larger
research project intending to measure self-stigma and physi-
cal health outcomes of adults who stutter (Boyle & Fearon,
2018). Participants in this study represent a subsample
from that project, which had different research aims, variables
of interest, and hypotheses.

Data Analysis

Data recorded by Qualtrics were exported to SPSS

Statistics Version 22. The data were checked for any possible
data entry or coding errors made by the authors that could
have resulted in outlying data, and none were found. Pre-
liminary statistical analyses included obtaining Cronbach’s
coefficient alpha to assess internal consistency of all sets of
items intending to measure variables of interest. Also, de-
scriptive statistics including means, standard deviations, and

summary scores from the CPIB were converted into T scores.
Primary analysis included obtaining bivariate Pearson and
Spearman correlations between variables depending on
measurement type. Bivariate correlation analysis was con-
ducted to identify potential relationships between demo-
graphic (age, sex, living situation, education, employment),
speech-related variables (speech usage, years stuttering,
physical speech disruption severity, stuttering treatment
history, stuttering support group history), predictor (self-
esteem, self-efficacy, social support), and criterion variables
(communicative participation). Correlations between all
variables were examined using Pearson and Spearman cor-
relations, depending on variable type (e.g., Spearman cor-
relations were calculated for items with ordinal response
options such as speech usage and social roles items). Point
biserial correlations were computed for analyses involving
dichotomous variables (e.g., sex, living situation, educa-
tion, employment). As mentioned earlier, demographic or
stuttering-related variables that were significantly correlated
with the predictor or outcome variables of interest were
added as covariates in the regression analysis. In addition,
the correlational analysis helped to determine if any vari-
ables were redundant (i.e., correlations greater than .70)
and could therefore be removed from the regression analysis.
Hierarchical regression was used because the primary

purpose of the study was to determine if self-esteem, self-
efficacy, and social support were predictive of communicative
participation above and beyond demographic and speech-
related variables (Petrocelli, 2003). According to Cohen
and Cohen (1983), the principal of causal priority can help
clarify the order of variables inserted into hierarchical re-
gression models. According to this principal, the order of
predictor variable entry is guided by causal flow (i.e., causes
should be entered before their effects). These guidelines
suggest that static variables such as demographic variables
should be entered on Step 1. Therefore, sex, living situation,
education, and employment were entered on Step 1. More
dynamic variables (e.g., speech and stuttering-related vari-
ables) should be entered in subsequent steps. Furthermore,
no independent variables entered later should be believed
to cause an independent variable that came earlier. There-
fore, the understanding that speech disruption and other
speech-related variables could theoretically impact psycho-
social variables such as self-esteem, self-efficacy, and social
support provides theoretical guidance for the order of variable
entry. Speech-related variables including speech usage, years
stuttering, treatment history, self-help support group history,
and physical speech disruption severity were entered on
Step 2, and self-esteem, self-efficacy, and social support were
entered simultaneously as the predictor variables in Step 3.
Communicative participation was the outcome variable of
interest. Variance inflation factor was examined in the re-
gression analysis, and multicollinearity was not a concern
(values were between 1.0 and 1.5 for all variables).

Finally, Spearman correlations were calculated to
determine the relationships between social roles variables
and communicative participation and physical speech

disruption. Effect sizes were also reported for all significant
correlation coefficients according to the widely used guide-
lines of Cohen (1992; i.e., product–moment r coefficients be-
tween .10 and .29 are considered small, between .30 and
.49 are considered medium, and > .50 are large).

In this study, possible Type I errors were controlled
for by analyzing only one dependent variable in regression
analysis and selecting predictor variables that were theoret-
ically relevant to the dependent variable. All correlational
and regression results reported tested a priori hypotheses.
In addition, the types of regression analyses utilized con-
trolled for contributions from other variables within the
model, and thus, the alpha values did not require modifica-
tion. Therefore, for the primary analyses of interest in this
study, the criterion of α = .05 was utilized to determine
statistical significance. The possibility of Type II error was
minimized by recruiting a large sample and using valid and
reliable self-report measures. A post hoc power analysis
conducted with GPower Version 3.1.2 (Faul, Erdfelder,
Buchner, & Lang, 2009) demonstrated that power was > 0.99
for the regression model used in the study, given the sample
size obtained and number of predictors utilized to detect at
least a medium effect size.

Results
Preliminary Analyses

Item analysis was conducted on sets of items intending
to measure the main constructs of interest. Cronbach’s co-
efficient alpha was calculated for each construct measured
with multiple items in order to assess the internal consis-
tency of those items. Internal consistency was judged to be
good to excellent for items measuring physical speech dis-
ruption severity (α = .87), self-esteem (α = .86), self-efficacy
(α = .86), social support (α = .81), and communicative par-
ticipation (α = .93), according to standards recommended
by Nunnally (1978). Therefore, it was justified to obtain
and report overall summary scores from items comprising
these constructs.

Descriptive statistics and frequency counts were also
calculated for each variable of interest. Regarding speech
usage, 5.4% rated their speech needs as “undemanding,”
21.9% reported “intermittent,” 39% reported “routine,”
22.2% reported “extensive,” and 11.4% reported “extra-
ordinary” speech demands. In addition, most rated their typi-
cal level of speech disruption (i.e., occurrence of repetitions,
prolongations, blocks, in addition to tension, effort, and
secondary behaviors) as moderate (M = 4.8, SD = 1.5),
and most reported the duration of their longest disfluencies
as typically lasting between 0.5 and 2 s. Table 2 displays
means, T scores, standard deviations, possible ranges, and
observed ranges for physical speech disruption severity,
self-esteem, self-efficacy, social support, and communicative
participation. Note that the “physical speech disruption
severity” values shown in Table 2 represent participants’
combined ratings of self-perceived severity of speech dis-
ruption (tension, effort, frequency of stuttering, secondary

characteristics) and self-reported length of disfluencies.
Therefore, the average of 8.9 for that variable reflects mod-
erate physical speech disruption overall for most participants.
It is worthwhile to highlight the fact that the mean T score
of adults who stutter in this sample was very similar to the
mean of 50 reported by Baylor et al. (2013) based on data
from 701 individuals with multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s
disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and head and neck
cancer.

Primary Analyses

Results indicated that all demographic, speech and

stuttering-related, and predictor variables were significantly
correlated with at least one of the variables of interest. Table 3
shows correlation coefficients between all variables. It should
also be noted that years of stuttering and age were highly
correlated, as would be expected (r = .96, p < .001), and
therefore, age was omitted from regression analysis because
its correlation to communicative participation was lower in
strength. No other pairs of correlations were above .70, and
therefore, all other variables were utilized in the regression
analysis. There are some significant correlations seen in
Table 3 worth noting. First, communicative participation
demonstrated significant positive correlations with age,

education, speech usage, and stuttering self-help/support
group history (small effect sizes), as well as self-esteem, self-
efficacy, and social support (medium effect sizes), and a
significant negative correlation with physical speech disrup-
tion (large effect size). History of participating in self-help/
support groups for stuttering was significantly correlated
with increased self-esteem (small effect size). Also, increased
speech usage was significantly and positively correlated with
education status and employment (small effect sizes), self-
esteem (medium effect size), self-efficacy (medium effect size),
and social support (small effect size) and negatively correlated
with physical speech disruption severity (small effect size).
Physical speech disruption severity was significantly and
negatively correlated with age, education, self-efficacy, and
social support (all small effect sizes), as well as self-esteem
(medium effect size).

Results of the hierarchical regression analysis revealed
that, after controlling for demographic and speech-related
variables, self-esteem, t(303) = 3.34, p = .001, self-efficacy,
t(303) = 3.07, p = .002, and social support, t(303) = 3.05,
p = .002, significantly predicted communicative participa-
tion. Self-esteem, self-efficacy, and social support accounted
for an additional 8.3% of the variance in communicative
participation beyond the variance explained by demographic
and speech-related variables (see Table 4). The overall

model accounted for 53.2% of the variance in communica-
tive participation.

Finally, it was of interest to analyze how social roles
variables were related to communicative participation and
physical speech disruption severity. One item from the
PROMIS Global Health Questionnaire (Hays et al., 2009)
measured social roles ability, and another item from that
same scale measured social roles satisfaction. Table 5 pro-
vides descriptive data for percentages of participants select-
ing certain response options for both of these questions. It
can be seen that most participants reported good or very
good ability to carry out their social roles, and most reported
good or very good satisfaction with social activities and re-
lationships. Bivariate Spearman correlations were calculated
between variables of communicative participation, social
roles ability, social roles satisfaction, and physical severity
of speech disruption. There was a significant positive relation-
ship between communicative participation and social roles
ability (r = .57, p < .001 [large effect size]) and also between
communicative participation and social roles satisfaction
(r = .58, p < .001 [large effect size]). There were significant
negative relationships between physical speech disruption
severity and social roles ability (r = −.39, p < .001 [medium

effect size]) and physical speech disruption severity and
social roles satisfaction (r = −.38, p < .001 [medium effect
size]). Correlations were therefore of greater magnitude
(larger effect sizes) between social roles variables and com-
municative participation than they were for social roles
variables and physical speech disruption.

Discussion

The purpose of this study was to determine if self-

esteem, self-efficacy, and social support predicted communi-
cative participation in adults who stutter, above and beyond
demographic and speech-related variables. It was hypothe-
sized that these psychosocial variables would be significant
predictors of communicative participation over and above
the variance accounted for by demographic and speech-
related variables. That hypothesis was supported in this
study. These findings support previous findings reported
for individuals with multiple sclerosis (Baylor, Amtmann, &
Yorkston, 2012; Baylor et al., 2010; Yorkston et al., 2014),
which demonstrated that a variety of demographic and
symptom-related variables, in addition to speech impairment
severity, significantly predicted communicative

by Boyle (2015) that reported two psychosocial variables,
social support, and self-efficacy, as predictive of quality
of life in adults who stutter beyond what was accounted
for by demographic and stuttering-related variables, includ-
ing severity of speech disruption. A secondary purpose of
this study was to determine correlations between commu-
nicative participation, social roles variables, and physical
speech disruption. The hypothesis that social roles variables
(social roles ability and social roles satisfaction) would be
more strongly related to communicative participation than
physical speech disruption was also supported in this study.
Again, these results are consistent with those of Yorkston
et al. (2014), who reported similar findings among individ-
uals with multiple sclerosis.

In this study, years of stuttering, physical speech
disruption severity, self-esteem, self-efficacy, and social
support were unique and significant predictors of commu-
nicative participation. Specifically, increased communicative
participation was found to be associated with longer history
of stuttering, less physical speech disruption severity, and
increased self-esteem, self-efficacy, and social support. The
results support the notion that self-rated severity of speech
disruption is related to negative outcomes such as quality
of life (Boyle, 2015; Iverach, Lowe, et al., 2017). The finding
that a longer history of stuttering was related to increased
communicative participation could be related to a higher
degree of acceptance of stuttering as a chronic condition or
the increase in use of adaptive coping strategies that could
be learned over several years. Smart (2001) discussed a stage
model of coping with disabilities where integration, accep-
tance, and transcendence of one’s disability come after
stages of shock, defensiveness, depression, and personal
questioning. Therefore, the findings may reflect increased
social and emotional adaptation to stuttering over time. The
results of this study also support earlier findings that iden-
tified the importance of self-efficacy and social support for
predicting resilience to stuttering and for buffering the neg-
ative impacts of stuttering (Blumgart et al., 2014; Craig
et al., 2011). Importantly, self-esteem, self-efficacy, and so-
cial support explained additional and significant variance
beyond what was accounted for by physical speech disrup-
tion severity.

Clinical Applications of Findings

Although targeting reduced severity of physical speech

disruption with speech modification approaches can be a
worthy treatment goal and one that has been shown to reli-
ably increase fluency in adults who stutter (Baxter et al.,
2015; Bothe, Davidow, Bramlett, & Ingham, 2006; Herder,
Howard, Nye, & Vanryckeghem, 2006), there are additional
factors that SLPs should take into account in order to under-
stand the impact of stuttering on communicative participa-
tion. The present findings demonstrate that variables such as
self-esteem, self-efficacy, and social support are relevant
for communicative participation of PWS as well. The results
of this study could help to identify PWS who are at risk for

communication restrictions (i.e., clients with shorter history
of stuttering; increased levels of physical speech disruption;
and lower levels of self-esteem, self-efficacy, and social
support) and indicate potential therapy objectives that would
help alleviate those restrictions.

To effectively change clinical practice and provide

more holistic services to PWS, concrete modifications need
to be made in assessment and treatment processes. SLPs
should feel competent in their ability to handle these clinical
duties. Psychosocial variables can be measured using scales
that document the life impact of stuttering (Overall Assess-
ment of the Speaker’s Experience of Stuttering; Yaruss &
Quesal, 2006), unhelpful thoughts and beliefs about stuttering
(Unhelpful Thoughts and Beliefs About Stuttering Scale; St.
Clare et al., 2009), self-efficacy related to speech (Self-Efficacy
Scale for Adults Stutterers; Ornstein & Manning, 1985), and
self-stigma related to stuttering (Self-Stigma of Stuttering
Scale; Boyle, 2013a). Scales that are not specific to stuttering
but are relevant for communicative participation, as suggested
in this article, could also be used (e.g., self-esteem, general-
ized self-efficacy, and perceived social support). The CPIB
short form (Baylor et al., 2013) used in this study is another
efficient method for assessing the important construct of com-
municative participation that could be used clinically. In fact,
as this study has shown, CPIB scores may better reflect
changes in social roles abilities and social roles satisfaction
than self-ratings of physical speech disruption severity. These
measures can be used to document treatment progress and
outcomes in stuttering therapy.

Regarding treatment options that could be expected
to improve communicative participation for PWS, clinicians
could focus on modification of speech behavior to alter
physical speech disruption severity (Bothe et al., 2006;
Herder et al., 2006) in addition to other cognitive and af-
fective strategies that could offer a holistic approach to im-
prove communicative participation. For example, counseling
approaches (Blood, 1995; Irani, Gabel, Daniels, & Hughes,
2012), psychological based therapies such as cognitive be-
havioral therapy (Helgadóttir, Menzies, Onslow, Packman,
& O’Brian, 2009; Menzies, O’Brian, Lowe, Packman, &
Onslow, 2016; Menzies et al., 2008), acceptance and com-
mitment therapy (Beilby, Byrnes, & Yaruss, 2012), and
mindfulness-based stress reduction (de Veer, Brouwers,
Evers, & Tomic, 2009) have been shown to be effective
for improving cognitive and affective challenges associated
with stuttering. For example, Menzies et al. (2008) found
that a combination of speech therapy and cognitive behav-
ioral therapy was more effective than speech therapy alone
in improving psychological functioning and reducing anxiety
and avoidance of previously feared speaking situations in
PWS. Those authors concluded that “speech restructuring
alone is insufficient as a treatment of the ‘whole person’
who stutters” (p. 1462). The results of the current study
support the notion that focusing only on severity of speech
disruption is inadequate for understanding the entire com-
munication experience of PWS. Because most SLPs realize
the importance of participation-focused therapy but report
barriers to implementation (Torrence et al., 2016), the

1902 Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research (cid:129) Vol. 61 (cid:129) 1893–1906 (cid:129) August 2018

approaches, such as those described above, can potentially
help SLPs in their treatment planning with clients who
stutter.

The results of the current study may also help to par-

tially explain several well-known phenomena commonly
observed in PWS. Some individuals exhibit covert stuttering
(i.e., passing as a fluent speaker to avoid being identified
as a PWS; Butler, 2013; Constantino et al., 2017; Murphy,
Quesal, & Gulker, 2007), some remain fearful and anxious
of stuttering occurring despite producing relatively fluent
speech (Finn, Howard, & Kubala, 2005), and many relapse
after being able to modify speech production during therapy
(Bloodstein & Bernstein-Ratner, 2008; Craig, 1998). All of
these phenomena have suggested that not all clients who
stutter believe that their communication problem is solved
when they are able to modify their speech production and
reduce their outward physical impairment following speech
therapy. That is, even if PWS seem to exhibit relatively flu-
ent speech at any particular time, they may be struggling
with a variety of barriers to social participation that are not
apparent on the surface. There are clearly other factors to
consider, and as the current findings suggest, the constructs
of self-efficacy, self-esteem, and perceived social support
are relevant for a more holistic perspective of the impact of
stuttering on PWS.

Limitations and Future Research Directions

There are some limitations to this study that can help
guide future research efforts on this topic. First, all variables
reported on in this study were obtained by self-report, in-
cluding physical speech disruption severity. Self-reported
ratings of physical speech disruption are different from data
resulting from performance-based tasks (e.g., percentage
of syllables stuttered from a speech sample). Future studies
should attempt to compare different types of severity ratings
and analyze their contributions to communicative partici-
pation. Furthermore, although the CPIB has been psycho-
metrically analyzed, it has not been formally validated for
PWS. Second, more variables could have been included in
this analysis given that only a little over half of the variance
in communicative participation was explained with the var-
iables examined. Future studies should attempt to measure
additional variables, including anxiety and depression. Third,
it is possible that, because the participants in this study were
recruited from SLPs and self-help leaders in stuttering, they
felt differently about stuttering or themselves compared to
PWS who have never sought help for stuttering. Therefore,
it is difficult to know whether the results can generalize
to the entire population of PWS. Finally, this study was
cross-sectional and correlational in nature, and so no
causal links between variables of interest can be made.
Future work in this area could seek to understand the
process of how communicative participation becomes
restricted (or increases) over time in PWS using qualita-
tive methods. Longitudinal prospective studies (Tran,
Blumgart, & Craig, 2017, provide an example of this type

of design) that follow PWS (e.g., before, during, and after
treatment) and document changes in communicative partic-
ipation over time would also demonstrate the effectiveness
of these approaches.

Conclusion

It is important that SLPs anticipate and identify the

many different factors that contribute to communicative
participation restrictions in clients who stutter. With this
knowledge, clinicians can also target these factors in treatment
to reduce barriers to communicative participation. Focusing
on psychosocial variables (e.g., personal and environmental
factors), in addition to behavioral variables (e.g., speech pro-
duction), will increase clinicians’ ability to treat the disorder
from a holistic perspective, as outlined in ASHA’s scope of
practice in speech-language pathology, that seeks to reduce
activity limitations and participation restrictions and improve
satisfaction with social roles and abilities in clients who stut-
ter. Because improving communicative participation and
quality of life of individuals with communication disorders
is the overall objective of speech-language pathology services,
identifying and targeting variables related to communicative
participation is important for all populations treated by
SLPs.
