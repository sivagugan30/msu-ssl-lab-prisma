Abstract
Deficits in auditory processing are an assumed underlying mechanism in stuttering. Previous studies have demonstrated that 
speech evoked auditory brainstem response (s-ABR) is a reliable method to evaluate brainstem timing in clinical popula-
tions with persistent developmental stuttering (PDS). The examination of s-ABR signals to quantify differential complexi-
ties between PDS and normal subjects using linear analysis is unreliable. This prompted us to evaluate non-linear methods, 
which are more effective for conveying complex dynamics. The aim of the current study is to apply fractal dimension and 
the Hurst exponent to s-ABR signals in order to identify complexity differences between PDS and normal subjects who were 
stimulated with the synthetic/da/stimulus. Analysis of scaling exponents showed a statistically significant difference between 
the two groups. The s-ABR signal in subjects with stuttering becomes more complex due to stimulation. These findings are 
discussed in terms of dysfunctional sub-cortical activation in PDS populations.

1  Introduction

Stuttering is a speech dysfluency characterized by inter-
ruptions in verbal fluency such as repetition, interjection, 
prolongation of sounds, syllables, words, and involuntary 
silent pauses (called blocking) during communication [1–5]. 
This disorder appears to affect males more prevalently with 
a ratio of 3:1 versus females [1, 6]. It is also estimated to 
occur in approximately 5% of children between 2 and 4 years 
of age [7].

Mechanisms underlying stuttering have been the focus 
of recent neurological studies. Abnormal neural activity

has been demonstrated in the subcortical regions and the 
auditory and motor areas related to stuttering [8, 9]. Mag-
netoencephalography (MEG) and imaging research have 
shown functional and structural abnormalities in the central 
nervous system of subjects with persistent developmental 
stuttering (PDS) [10–13]. Foundas et al. showed that there 
is an anomalous planum temporale (PT) asymmetry in sub-
jects with PDS [8]. Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), 
Sommer et al. showed that white matter fiber in the left oper-
culum in stutterers is less dense compared to adults who do 
not stutter [14]. Researchers have also investigated the brain 
activity of subjects with PDS and their findings suggested 
different hemispheric speech-motor processing occurs com-
pared to non-stutterers [10, 11, 14–17].

Neural deficits in speech regions, such as the auditory 
brainstem, are thought to be a possible site of origin for 
central auditory deficits in stutterers [18–21]; thus, evoked 
potential  responses  may  provide  important  information 
about the relationship between neural activities and stutter-
ing. A review of the literature suggests that several electro-
physiological tests, such as electroencephalography (EEG), 
auditory brainstem response (ABR), frequency following 

Vol:.(1234567890)1 3response (FFR), and speech evoked ABR (s-ABR), may be 
highly suitable for identifying brainstem timing deficits.

Recent studies have shown that the s-ABR signal is a 
reliable method for evaluating brainstem timing in clinical 
populations with auditory processing impairments [22–24]. 
Electrophysiological and medical studies have revealed cor-
tical dysfunctions in stuttering [25, 26]. Mismatch negativity 
(MMN) abnormalities in PDS subjects have been reported 
related to stuttering. The MMN response between subjects 
with  PDS  and  normal  speakers  were  compared  in  [25]. 
Smaller p600 amplitudes were shown in stutterers, suggest-
ing unusual syntactic processing [26].

The s-ABR signal consists of transient and sustained 
responses, specifically the onset and the frequency-follow-
ing response (FFR) [27, 28]. Transient responses are non-
periodic characteristics of the stimulus, while FFRs are 
sustained time-locked responses including periodic char-
acteristics of the stimulus [27–29]. The s-ABR signal is a 
non-invasive and objective tool for studying the role of the 
brainstem in encoding complex sounds in individuals with 
developmental and learning problems, for assessing auditory 
pathways at the rostral part of the brainstem, and for measur-
ing brainstem timing at this level [23, 24, 28–30].

The  binaural  masking  level  difference  (BMLD)  and 
interaural phase difference (IPD) tests [19, 31] are subjective 
tests using linear methods in time and frequency domains 
to compare adults who stutter with normal adults who do 
not stutter [32].

Over the past two decades, several linear methods in time 
and frequency domains have been used to evaluate s-ABR, 
such as peak latency and amplitude, cross-correlation, and 
Fourier analysis [29, 30, 33]. Recently, peak latency and 
Fourier analysis have been applied to compare adults who 
stutter with normal adults who do not stutter [24]. Based 
on this study, there are significant group differences for the 
peaks of the onset and offset transient. However, these tests 
fail to reveal the more exacting differences and dynamic fea-
tures of the underlying signals. Furthermore, most quantita-
tive approaches for assessing the temporal dynamics of the 
s-ABR require the s-ABR series to be stationary [34].

Another consideration is that these applied tests are lin-
ear methods, while neuronal interactions are non-linear and 
superposition is not satisfied in this context [35]. Recent 
studies have shown that signals derived from the auditory 
brainstem system demonstrate non-linear and non-stationary 
characteristics [36, 37]. Recently, we used a methodology to 
determine chaotic features of various components of s-ABR 
signals by performing Ensemble Empirical Mode Decompo-
sition (EEMD). Our findings provided evidence in support 
of chaos in s-ABR [38].

Fractal analysis is one of the most well-known non-linear 
methods for studying non-linear and non-stationary biologi-
cal dynamics [39, 40]. Scale-invariant behaviors are have 

491

been demonstrated in many time series extracted from bio-
logical systems, such as electromyography (EMG), electro-
cardiography (ECG), and electroencephalography (EEG) 
[41–45].

Therefore, in this paper, the s-ABR signal was used as a 
quantitative and objective approach to identify brainstem 
deficits in stuttering. In order to confirm the presence of a 
difference between s-ABR signals of healthy and PDS sub-
jects, non-linear criteria are presented. We compare s-ABR 
signals of adults with developmental stuttering to normal 
subjects using fractal dimension and the Hurst exponent to 
quantitatively measure the involvement of the brainstem in 
stuttering. These features enable the extraction of non-linear 
information from s-ABR signals in both groups.

2   Materials and Methods

We aim to investigate the effect of an auditory stimulus 
(speech syllable/da/) on the fractal dynamics of s-ABR sig-
nal. We utilized fractal dimension as a measure of process 
complexity, where a greater value corresponds to a more 
complex process.

The fractal dimension can be determined using several 
methods (such as box counting, information dimension, 
and correlation dimension) [46] that approximate scaling 
and detail from limits, which are estimated from regression 
lines over log–log plots of size versus scale. All of these 
methods can be seen as special cases of a continuous spec-
trum of generalized fractal dimensions. Here we define the 
generalized fractal dimension. The fractal exponent is based 
on the entropy concept for a probability distribution [47]. 
For instance, in the case of a time series (s-ABR signal in 
our research) with the range of variation between Vmax and 
Vmin , the total range can be divided into N bins, where each 
bin has the size of 𝛿 ∈:
Vmax − Vmin
𝛿 ∈

N =

(1)

.

So, the probability of a value to fall into the i-th bin:

wi = lim
N→∞

Ni
N

.

(2)

In Eq. (2) Ni is the number of times the value falls into the 

i-th bin. For a time series, it can be written as:

wi = lim
T→∞

ti
T

.

(3)

In Eq. (3), ti stands for the total time that the value spends 

in the i-th bin, and T is the total time.

The generalized fractal dimensions of order q are defined 

by [48]:

where ∈ is the scaling factor.

In this study, we employed the box counting method to 
calculate the fractal dimension. In fact, the fractal dimen-
sion, D, is estimated as the exponent of a power law:

D = lim
∈→0

log N(∈)
log ∈

(5)

where fractal dimension is estimated from a regression line 
of the log–log plot of the number boxes used to fill (N), ver-
sus scaling factor ( ∈ ), which is called box size here.

Additionally, we employed the Hurst exponent in order 
to analyze the s-ABR signals. The Hurst exponent, which 
indicates the randomness of a time series, ranges between 
0 and 1, where a random process is indicated by a value 
being nearer to 0.5 [49]. The Hurst exponent relates to the 
predictability of a fractal time series as it is computed from 
the history of the time series and represents the long-term 
memory of the process.

For our experiments, we play a 40 ms speech syllable/da/
for both the normal and stuttering subjects and then analyze 
the complexity and randomness of their s-ABR signals using 
fractal dimension and the Hurst exponent, respectively.

2.1   Participants and Procedures

2.1.1   Subjects

Fourteen individuals with PDS (8 men and 6 women), aged 
16–35 years (mean ± SD = 25.50 ± 2.05) contributed to this 
experiment from the IRAN Society of Stuttering and the 
Speech Therapy Department of the Iran University of Medi-
cal Sciences. Fifteen fluent subjects (8 men and 7 women), 
aged 16–35 years (mean ± SD = 25.77 ± 1.24) served as the 
control group. Based on their self-report, subjects were 
right-handed and monolingual Persian speakers with no his-
tory of auditory, learning, or neurologic problems. They had 
normal hearing sensitivities (pure tone thresholds) at octave 
intervals ranging from 250 to 4000 Hz (≤ 20 dBHL). Clini-
cal diagnoses of developmental stuttering were evaluated 
by speech-language pathologists. Subjects in the stuttering 
group suffered from stuttering for more than 10 years. The 
severity of stuttering was evaluated by the Persian version 
of the Stuttering Severity Instrument-3 (SSI-3) and ranged 
from mild to severe. All stuttering adults had clinical criteria 
of developmental stuttering. Informed consent documenta-
tion was signed by all subjects that participated in this study. 
The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee 
of Iran University of Medical Sciences.

The stimulus consisted of a 40 ms speech syllable/da/pro-
vided with a Klatt synthesizer at the rate of 10 kHz by the 
Biologic Navigator instrument (Natus Medical Inc., San 
Carlos, CA, USA). The fundamental frequency  (F0) of this 
syllable was 128 Hz. The complex nature of combining 
both transient and sustained features, the universality of 
the syllable in most phonetic inventories, and its research 
potential in hearing and learning disorders typically moti-
vate researchers to utilize the consonant–vowel stimulus/da/
in auditory brainstem studies [30]. The contact electrodes 
were positioned at the vertex (Cz) as noninverting, earlobes 
(inverting), and forehead (Fpz) as ground. A Bio-logic insert 
earphone (580-SINSER) was used to present the stimulus 
at 80 dB SPL. Speech-ABR responses were recorded using 
1024 digital sampling points over an 85.33 ms time window 
(15 ms pre-stimulus) in the right ear. Finally, the average 
of a total 6000 responses was collected from each subject.

2.2   Data Analysis

After an initial screening of the collected data, one subject 
was removed from each group for further analysis. To reduce 
noise in the recorded s-ABR signals, we smoothed the signal 
before proceeding with the calculation of fractal dimension. 
Figure 1 shows a sample of a raw and filtered s-ABR signal 
for both a normal and stuttering subject.

We computed the fractal dimension and the Hurst expo-
nent for the filtered signal using box counting [46]. The algo-
rithm, which was written in MATLAB, uses a range of box 
1
, … ) as scaling factor in order to scan the signal 
sizes ( 
2
and then compute the fractal dimension based on Eq. (5), 
which fits a regression line to the log–log plot of N over ∈ . 
For each scaling factor ( ∈ ), N is the total number boxes used 
to cover the signal.

In addition, the computation of the Hurst exponent was 

based on its relation to the fractal dimension:

H = 2 − F.

(6)
For statistical analysis, the computed values of the frac-
tal dimension and the Hurst exponent were first tested for 
normality and equality of variance using the Anderson–Dar-
ling test and Levene’s test, respectively. Peak latency was 
also analyzed to compare our results with that of linear 
approaches. Then, to compare the mean values of the fractal 
dimension of the s-ABR signal between the two groups of 
subjects, we performed a t test.

In order to show the importance of fractal analysis, we 
also carried out linear analysis (latency of peaks) on s-ABR 
signals. The results of the linear analysis were compared 
with the non-linear analysis using effect size.

3   Results

Figure 2 indicates the stimulus/da/and s-ABR signals used 
for further analysis. Figure 3 shows the responses of the 
s-ABR in the stutterer and control groups.

Table 1 displays the p-values observed for a test of dif-
ference in latency peaks between normal and PDS subjects. 
Except for the significant difference observed for V peaks, 
there were no significant differences in peak values between 
normal and PDS subjects. Therefore, the linear analysis was 
not able to effectively distinguish the difference between the 
s-ABR signals of normal versus PDS subjects.

Application of the Anderson–Darling test to the com-
puted fractal dimension (and Hurst exponent) data sets 
for both the control group and stutterer group followed 
the normal distribution with a confidence level of 2.9 and 
18.3%, respectively. In addition, the result of Levene’s test, 

0.6880, was smaller than the F value (4.2596). Therefore, 
the condition of equality of variance was also fulfilled.

Figure 4 shows the variations of the fractal dimension 

of the s-ABR signal for the two subject groups.

As shown in Fig. 4, the group of subjects with stuttering 
have a larger fractal dimension value for s-ABR signal on 
average. Considering 𝛼 = 0.05 , the t test result (p = 0.019) 
supports a significant difference for the fractal dynamics 
of s-ABR signals between the two groups. Since the fractal 
dimension represents the complexity of the process, it can 
be said that variations of complexity in the s-ABR signal 
of subjects with stuttering are more dominant than in nor-
mal subjects. In other words, the brains of subjects with 
stuttering show a greater response to the applied stimulus.
In order to verify the results, we computed the Hurst 
exponent for s-ABR signals. Figure 5 shows the variations

of the Hurst exponent for the s-ABR signals from the two 
groups of subjects.

As shown in Fig. 5, the group of subjects with stuttering 
exhibits a lower average Hurst exponent value for s-ABR 
signal. Considering 𝛼 = 0.05 , the t test result (p = 0.019) 
supports a significant difference in the Hurst exponent of 
the s-ABR signals between the two groups. Since the Hurst 
exponent represents the memory of the process, it can be 
said that the variations of memory in the s-ABR signal of 
subjects with stuttering were less than in normal subjects. 
This result verifies the effect observed for fractal dimen-
sion. Having a greater fractal dimension should lead to a 

1 3 
 
 
 
Hurst exponent with a value closer to 0.5 (i.e., complete 
random condition) and accordingly having less memory.

Overall, the analysis of s-ABR signals shows that s-ABR 
signal for subjects with stuttering becomes more complex 
with stimulation. This result was further validated by com-
puting the Hurst exponent for s-ABR signals.

4   Discussion and Conclusion

The main goal of this paper was to evaluate whether any 
difference in complexity exists between PDS and normal 
subjects using non-linear analysis and then to quantify this 
difference using fractal dimension and the Hurst exponent to 
s-ABR signal. A simultaneous goal was to evaluate whether 
non-linear features of neural encoding at the brainstem level 
differed in adults with PDS versus normal adults. In contrast 
to the conventional approach, in which time and frequency 
domain methods are employed to assess s-ABR signals, our 
proposed method corresponds to the nature of the under-
lying s-ABR signals. Since s-ABR signals have non-linear 
and non-stationary characteristics, this non-linear dynamical 
approach is particularly suited and more robust for quan-
tification of and comparison of the complexity of the two 
different groups.

In this study, we investigated the fractal dimension of 
s-ABR signals in a group of adults with persistent develop-
mental stuttering. We observed that the fractal dimension of 
the s-ABR signals of the PDS group was significantly differ-
ent from that of the control group. Since fractal dimension 
describes the complexity of a mechanism, the s-ABR signals 
of adults with PDS have more complex structure compared 
to the normal subjects. In a following step, we also calcu-
lated the Hurst exponent for the normal versus stuttering 
subjects, where the results demonstrated a significant dif-
ference between the two subject groups.

The simulation results of our method were also compared 
to peak latency analysis, which is currently used in clin-
ics. The linear time delay analysis showed that, except for a 
significant difference between normal and PDS subjects for 
V peak values, the differences between peak values were 
not significant between groups (Table 1). Therefore, the 
linear analysis was not able to clearly distinguish a differ-
ence between s-ABR signals of normal versus PDS subjects. 
The results of Hurst exponent analysis showed a significant 
group difference between the PDS and normal subjects. 
Since the Hurst exponent is related to the long-term memory 
of the process, it is possible that memory variations in the 
s-ABR signal of subjects with stuttering are less than normal 
subjects. The comparison of results from fractal analysis and 
linear analysis confirmed the effectiveness of fractal analysis 
for investigating the non-linear dynamic of s-ABR signal.

The  observed  significant  differences  between  normal 
and PDS subjects may arise due to sub-cortical activation. 
In fact, medical and psychological groups offer evidence 
of insufficiency of the cortical activities in PDS subjects 
[24–26, 50]. These results also demonstrate the fact that stut-
tering is associated with a deficiency of speech encoding at 
the brainstem level that accordingly results in significant 
differences from normal subjects.

Based on the results of current study, fractal analysis is 
an appropriate method for application in clinical popula-
tions. This method can be further applied during stuttering 
remediation monitoring in order to follow speech fluency 
programs of subjects who stutter [51, 52]. Also, this may be 
especially useful for the diagnosis of other auditory process-
ing disorders (APD) and learning disabilities [53, 54]. Since 
the nature of s-ABR signals vary greatly in normal and APD 
populations [54, 55], fractal analysis would be interesting to 
apply as an objective method that is desirable from both a 
therapeutic and educational viewpoint. In sum, these find-
ings can be used to further our knowledge of PDS and its 
relationship to auditory abnormality.
