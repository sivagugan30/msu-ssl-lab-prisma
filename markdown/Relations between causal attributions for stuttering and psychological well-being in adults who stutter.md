  Abstract 
  Purpose : This study attempted to understand the relationship between causal attributions for stuttering and psychological 
well-being in adults who stutter. 
  Method : The  study  employed  a  cross-sectional  design  using  a  web  survey  distribution  mode  to  gain  information  related 
to  causal  attributions  and  psychological  well-being  of  348  adults  who  stutter.  Correlation  analyses  were  conducted  to 
determine relationships between participants ’  causal attributions (i.e. locus of causality, external control, personal control, 
stability, biological attributions, non-biological attributions) for stuttering and various measures of psychological well-being 
including self-stigma, self-esteem/self-efﬁ cacy, hope, anxiety and depression. 
  Result : Results indicated that higher perceptions of external control of stuttering were related to signiﬁ cantly lower ratings 
of hope and self-esteem/self-efﬁ cacy and higher ratings of anxiety and depression. Higher perceptions of personal control of 
stuttering were related to signiﬁ cantly lower ratings of self-stigma and higher ratings of hope and self-esteem/self-efﬁ cacy. 
Increased biological attributions were signiﬁ cantly related to higher ratings of permanency and unchangeableness of stut-
tering and lower ratings of personal control of stuttering. 
  Conclusion : The ﬁ ndings demonstrate the importance of instilling a sense of control in PWS regarding their ability to manage 
their stuttering. Findings also raise questions regarding the beneﬁ ts of educating PWS about the biological underpinnings 
of stuttering.

  Introduction 

 Effective  treatment  of  stuttering  requires  a  multi-
dimensional  perspective  of  the  disorder  including 
psychosocial components (Beilby, 2014). For many 
individuals who stutter, the disorder of stuttering can 
lead  to  decrements  in  psychological  well-being, 
including  experiences  of  anxiety  (Craig   &   Tran, 
2014), helplessness, shame, fear, avoidance (Butler, 
2013;  Corcoran   &   Stewart,  1998),  and  self-stigma 
(Boyle, 2013a). These reactions to stuttering consti-
tute  contextual  factors  that  limit  the  quality-of-life 
of people who stutter (PWS) by reducing social par-
ticipation (Bricker-Katz, Lincoln,  &  McCabe, 2009; 
Daniels, Gabel,  &  Hughes, 2012). It has been stated 
that these negative psychological outcomes are natu-
ral  following  repeated  frustration  and  embarrass-
ment  due  to  living  with  a  communication  disorder 
such  as  stuttering  (Iverach,  O ’ Brian,  Jones,  Block, 
Lincoln,  Harrison,  et    al.,  2009;  Manning   &   Beck, 
2013a). This is particularly true given that stuttering 
is a publically stigmatised disorder that elicits nega-
tive  public  reactions  such  as  teasing  and  bullying 

(Blood et   al., 2011; Cook  &  Howell, 2014) and social 
rejection (Van Borsel, Brepoels,  &  De Coene, 2011). 
Although there is plentiful evidence of the negative 
impact of public stigma on PWS, less focus has been 
given to identifying protective factors of psychologi-
cal  well-being  in  PWS  (Craig,  Blumgart,   &   Tran, 
2011). This  study  examines  the  relevance  of  causal 
attributions for stuttering to various components of 
psychological well-being in adults who stutter.  

 Causal attribution 

 Causal  attribution  is  related  to  how  an  individual 
explains the causes of certain behaviours and perfor-
mances (Weiner, 2010). Speciﬁ cally, causal attribu-
tion,  as  it  is  described  in  this  paper,  utilises  the 
description given by McAuley, Duncan, and Russell 
(1992),  which  focuses  on  four  causal  dimensions 
called  locus  of  causality,  stability,  external  control 
and  personal  control.  According  to  those  authors, 
locus of causality refers to whether the cause is per-
ceived as residing within the attributor or is external

to the attributor. Stability refers to whether the cause 
is perceived as stable or variable over time. External 
control  refers  to  whether  the  cause  is  perceived  as 
being controlled by other people. Personal control is 
whether  the  cause  is  perceived  as  being  controlled 
by  the  actor.  Authors  such  as  Russell  (1982)  and 
Weiner (2010) explained that causal attributions are 
situation-speciﬁ c  rather  than  measuring  general 
beliefs.  For  example,  if  individuals  were  asked  why 
they had received a high or low score on an examina-
tion in school, they could potentially think of many 
reasons  for  this  outcome.  For  example,  they  could 
attribute the test score to an internal cause reﬂ ecting 
an aspect of themselves (internal locus of causality) 
or an external cause reﬂ ecting an aspect of the situ-
ation (external locus of causality). The achievement 
of  the  test  scores  obtained  or  judgements  of  future 
performance  on  tests  could  be  perceived  as  more 
under  the  power  of  other  people  (external  control) 
or more manageable by the person themselves (per-
sonal  control).  Finally,  the  causes  of  the  results  in 
obtaining  the  exam  score  could  be  interpreted  as 
stable or unstable over time. 

 Causal attribution is a major component of Attri-
bution Theory  (Weiner,  1986),  which  predicts  that 
the public will respond to individuals with stigmatised 
conditions with more blame and anger if they believe 
that  the  condition  is  relatively  controllable.  Con-
versely, according to the theory, public responses of 
sympathy  and  willingness  to  help  will  increase  the 
less controllable the condition is perceived (Weiner, 
Perry,   &   Magnusson,  1988). This  theory  has  been 
supported in more recent research dealing with autism 
spectrum  disorders  (Ling,  Mak,   &   Cheng,  2010), 
self-harm  and  challenging  behaviours  (Dilworth, 
Phillips,   &   Rose,  2011;  Law,  Rostill-Brookes,   &  
Goodman,  2009),  eating  and  weight  disorders 
(Ebneter,  Latner,   &   O ’ Brien,  2011),  schizophrenia 
(Lincoln,  Arens,  Berger,   &   Rief,  2008),  and  drug 
addiction  (Corrigan,  Kuwabara,   &   O ’ Shaughnessy, 
2009). Recently, Boyle (2014) reported survey results 
from 330 school-based speech-language pathologists 
(SLPs) in the US who reported their perceptions of 
stuttering controllability and endorsements of blam-
ing individuals for stuttering. Results indicated that 
higher ratings of perceived controllability of stutter-
ing were signiﬁ cantly related to increased ratings of 
blaming  individuals  for  their  stuttering.  Blame  was 
related to signiﬁ cantly increased levels of stereotypes 
and dislike toward PWS. 

 Despite evidence in support of attribution theory 
in  the  public,  it  is  not  yet  known  how  the  causal 
attributions  described  previously  relate  to  psycho-
logical well-being in PWS. Although the concept of 
 “ locus  of  control  of  behaviour ”   (i.e.  individuals ’  
beliefs that what happens to them is an outcome of 
their own behaviour) has been studied in PWS, the 
focus of these studies has largely been on determin-
ing  if  locus  of  control  is  predictive  of  post-therapy 
ﬂ uency  outcomes  and  results  have  been  mixed 
(Block, Onslow, Packman,  &  Dacakis, 2006; Craig, 

1998;  Craig   &   Andrews,  1985;  Craig,  Franklin, 
 &  Andrews, 1984; De Nil  &  Kroll, 1995; Ginsberg, 
2000; Madison, Budd,  &  Itzkowitz, 1986). Further-
more,  the  locus  of  control  measure  (the  Locus  of 
Control  of  Behaviour  Scale  by  Craig  et    al.,  1984) 
employed  in  most  of  the  previously  cited  studies 
is  more  general,  focusing  on  a  broad  range  of  life 
events, rather than focusing on speciﬁ c situations in 
which stuttering occurs. One exception is a study by 
McDonough  and  Quesal  (1988)  that  analysed  cor-
relations between speech locus of control and a vari-
ety of psychological variables in 21 PWS and 21 ﬂ uent 
individuals  including  anxiety  and  communication 
attitude. The  results  indicated  that  higher  external 
speech control ratings were correlated with increased 
anxiety  and  more  negative  communication  attitude 
scores.  Still,  the  locus  of  control  variable  measured 
in the previously mentioned studies is a fundamen-
tally different construct than causal attribution as it 
is being described in this paper and, therefore, does 
not measure the same thing. This distinction will be 
described in detail in the following paragraph. 

 Lee,  Manning,  and  Herder  (2011)  described  the 
concept of  “ locus of causality ” , which is a different 
construct  than  locus  of  control.  Locus  of  causality 
represents individuals ’  personal perceptions of causes 
of  outcomes,  whereas  locus  of  control  represents 
beliefs about the extent to which one ’ s actions cause 
the reinforcement that follows it. Those authors used 
 “ origin ”   and   “ pawn ”   scaling,  a  type  of  qualitative 
content analysis, on writings about a recent speaking 
experience of 20 adults who stutter to determine if 
changes in locus of causality were demonstrated fol-
lowing a 3-week intensive therapy program. Results 
indicated  that,  after  therapy,  participants  generally 
demonstrated  increased   “ origin ”   scores  and  lower 
 “ pawn ”  scores, meaning that perceptions of personal 
control  increased.  Higher  origin  scores  were  also 
linked  to  lower  negative  life  impact  of  stuttering. 
Interestingly,  locus  of  control,  measured  by  the 
Locus of Control of Behaviour (LCB) Scale (Craig 
et   al., 1984) did not change following treatment and 
LCB  scores  were  not  signiﬁ cantly  associated  with 
origin  and  pawn  scores. This  study  highlights  that 
there  is  an  important  distinction  between  locus  of 
control and locus of causality. It is important to note 
for  this  study  that  locus  of  causality  is  more  theo-
retically relevant to the attribution theory and causal 
attributions discussed previously than locus of con-
trol. It is, therefore, causal attribution (which includes 
the  domain  of  locus  of  causality)  that  is  of  interest 
in this study, and not locus of control. 

 What has not been investigated thoroughly to date 
is the topic of whether attributions for the causes of 
stuttering relate to psychological well-being in PWS. 
Although  it  may  appear  common  sense  to  assume 
that  increased  feelings  of  personal  control  would 
relate  positively  to  well-being,  this  may  not  be  the 
case. It is possible that if PWS believe that they are 
primarily  responsible  for  causing  their  stuttering 
they  will  experience  lower  levels  of  psychological 

well-being. De Nil and Kroll (1995) actually found 
that  PWS  reporting  a  more  externalised  locus  of 
control also reported less relapse of speech ﬂ uency. 
The authors of that study reasoned that people with 
a  strong  sense  of  personal  control  may  experience 
psychological  trauma  when  they  over-estimate  the 
amount  of  control  they  really  have  in  a  situation. 
Considering that a loss of control is one of the deﬁ n-
ing  characteristics  of  a  stuttering  disorder  (Perkins, 
1990), it is possible that over-estimating one ’ s sense 
of  control  over  this  condition  could  have  negative 
psychological  implications  including  reduced  toler-
ance of failure. Although this question has not been 
explored to date in the population of PWS, one study 
from the ﬁ eld of psychology is relevant to consider. 
Mak and Wu (2006) interviewed 162 mental health 
consumers  to  examine  the  relationship  between 
attribution of responsibility for mental illness (using 
items from the Causal Dimension Scale II) and self-
stigma  (using  a  scale  created  by  the  researchers  of 
that study). The results of that study indicated that 
higher  perceived  personal  responsibility  for  mental 
illness  was  related  to  signiﬁ cantly  higher  levels  of 
self-stigma. Although this study did not include PWS 
or  measure  attributions  for  stuttering,  it  is  known 
that PWS experience self-stigma in the form of self-
defeating  thoughts  and  self-discriminating  behav-
iours (Boyle, 2013a, 2015b). Therefore, in the current 
study, it seemed relevant to determine whether causal 
attributions were linked to psychological well-being, 
including self-stigma, in PWS if attributions speciﬁ c 
to stuttering were measured with a reliable tool.   

 Biological vs non-biological attributions 

 Another  aspect  of  causal  attribution  involves  the 
degree  to  which  individuals  perceive  stigmatising 
conditions as biological or non-biological (Breheny, 
2007; Sears, Pomerantz, Segrist,  &  Rose, 2011). For 
example,  it  has  been  suggested  that  genetic  or  bio-
logical  explanations  of  disordered  behaviour  could 
reduce  public  stigma  against  individuals  with  dis-
abilities (Phelan, 2002). The reasoning for this argu-
ment is that the discovery of genetic components and 
neurological underpinnings of various disorders may 
help  the  public  view  disordered  behaviour  as 
more  of  an  individual  difference  on  a  continuum 
as  opposed  to  being  totally  dichotomous  with 
 “ non-disordered ”  behaviour. In addition, biological 
explanations  have  been  promoted  as  a  strategy  to 
potentially reduce blame, anger, and punishment of 
individuals  with  disabilities  and  increase  sympathy 
and helping (see Phelan, 2005, for a review of sus-
pected  beneﬁ ts  of  emphasising  biological  causes  of 
disorders). 

 Although there is now considerable evidence that 
stuttering  is  a  neurodevelopmental  disorder  with  a 
strong  genetic  component  (Beal,  Gracco,  Brettsch-
neider, Kroll,  &  De Nil, 2013; Kraft  &  Yairi, 2012), 
the public, and even professionals, have been reported 

  Causal attributions for stuttering

to  believe  that  stuttering  is  mostly  a  non-biological 
disorder that lacks a physical component (Van Borsel, 
Verniers,  &  Bouvry, 1999; Xing Ming, Jing, Yi Wen, 
 &  Van Borsel, 2001). Boyle (2014) found that higher 
reported sympathy for individuals with communica-
tion  disorders  was  signiﬁ cantly  related  to  stronger 
biological  attributions  for  those  disorders  among 
school-based SLPs. Boyle, Blood, and Blood (2009) 
provided  different  causal  explanations  (genetic  vs 
psychological) about stuttering to various groups of 
university  students  and  measured  participants ’   rat-
ings  of  negative  stereotypes  and  social  distance 
toward  PWS.  Results  of  that  study  demonstrated 
that  individuals  who  received  the  psychological 
explanation for stuttering rated PWS as having more 
negative personality characteristics and desired more 
social  distance  from  PWS,  compared  to  the  group 
that  received  the  genetic  explanation. The  implica-
tion  of  these  research  studies  is  that  the  more  bio-
logical stuttering is perceived by the public (as opposed 
to  psychological),  the  more  positive  the  perceptions 
of  PWS  will  be.  It  is  possible  that  biological  and 
non-biological attributions of individuals who stutter 
regarding their own stuttering are related to psycho-
logical  well-being,  although  this  potential  link  has 
not been investigated to date.   

 Psychological variables relevant for people who stutter 

 Although there are many potential measures of psy-
chological  well-being  that  could  be  studied  in  rela-
tion to causal attributions, the current study focused 
on  several  psychological  variables  that  have  been 
documented  to  be  relevant  to  measure  in  PWS, 
including self-stigma (Boyle, 2013a), anxiety (Craig 
 &  Tran, 2014), depression (Manning  &  Beck, 2013b), 
self-esteem/self-efﬁ cacy  (Boyle,  2013b),  and  hope 
(Plexico,  Manning,   &   DiLollo,  2010).  All  of  these 
variables  are  also  relevant  to  the  attribution  theory 
model described above. Perceptions of personal con-
trollability and stability of a condition or disorder, as 
well  as  biological  or  non-biological  attributions  for 
the disorder, may have implications for how hopeful 
and  self-efﬁ cacious  a  person  feels  in  being  able  to 
modify the condition, or how depressed, anxious, or 
hopeless  they  feel  coping  with  a  disorder  (R ü sch, 
Todd, Bodenhausen,  &  Corrigan, 2010; Weiner et   al., 
1988). It is also possible that perceptions of personal 
controllability are relevant to the self-stigma process 
(Mak  &  Wu, 2006).   

 Purpose of the current study 

 From the review above, it can be seen that measures 
of  causal  attributions  for  stuttering  behaviours  are 
limited.  Obtaining  causal  attributions  (i.e.  personal 
perceptions of causality) related to speciﬁ c situations 
in which stuttering occurs would provide beneﬁ cial 
it  could  assess 
additional 

information  because

multiple dimensions (e.g. locus of causality, external 
control, stability, personal control) and focus exclu-
sively  on  stuttering  events.  Psychometrically  sound 
scales do exist to measure the different causal attri-
bution  domains,  including  the  Causal  Dimension 
Scale (CDS) II (McAuley et   al., 1992), but this has 
not  yet  been  adapted  to  stuttering  in  previous 
research. 

 Given  the  lack  of  data  regarding  causal  attribu-
tions for stuttering among PWS and their potential 
links to well-being, the purpose of this study was to 
investigate  the  relationship  between  causal  attribu-
tions  (locus  of  causality,  stability,  external  control, 
personal  control,  biological  attributions  and  non-
biological attributions) and psychological well-being 
(hope,  self-esteem/self-efﬁ cacy,  anxiety,  depression, 
self-stigma) in a sample of adults who stutter. Because 
it  is  possible  that  participants ’   perceived  level  of 
speech  disruption  could  also  be  related  to  psycho-
logical well-being, it was desirable to control for this 
factor. Based on previous research in causal attribu-
tions, there could be two different outcomes regard-
ing  the  link  between  attributions  and  well-being. 
Some  research  suggests  that  higher  ratings  of  bio-
logical  attributions  and  lower  perceived  personal 
controllability  for  stuttering  would  be  related  to 
increased psychological well-being (e.g., self-stigma). 
However, despite the predictions of attribution the-
ory, it could also be the case that increased personal 
controllability  could  be  positively  related  to  well-
being because it may indicate increased self-efﬁ cacy 
and hope. This study aimed to answer the question 
of how causal attributions for stuttering were linked 
to  psychological  well-being  in  PWS.  A  secondary 
research  question  was  to  explore  the  relationships 
between  self-rated  level  of  speech  disruption  and 
causal  attributions.  By  identifying  factors  that  are 
related to psychological well-being in PWS, it will be 
possible to design treatment strategies that buffer the 
negative  psychological  impact  of  stuttering  and 
enhance well-being for individuals struggling to cope 
with the disorder.    

 Method  

 Participants 

 Participants  in  this  study  were  348  individuals  who 
stutter aged 18 and above (198 men and 93 women, 
while  57  participants  did  not  indicate  gender) 
recruited with the help of speech-language patholo-
gists and self-help support group networks in the US. 
Please note that data from participants in this data-
set  were  utilized  in  two  previous  studies  with  inde-
pendent aims and hypotheses. The participants were 
included in a previous study from a 354 person sam-
ple intending to further establish construct validity of 
a  new  scale  designed  to  assess  self-stigma  in  adults 
who  stutter  (Boyle,  2015b).  In  addition,  a  smaller 
sub-set  of  participants  was  utilised  in  a  study 

investigating psychosocial predictors of quality-of-life 
in adults who stutter (Boyle, 2015a). In the current 
study, participants out of the total 354 person sample 
were  included  if  they  provided  answers  for  at  least 
one of the main attribution variables of interest. Par-
ticipants all stated that they were people who stutter 
and  were  aged  18  or  above  before  they  could  com-
plete the study. The sample had a mean  (cid:2)  SD age of 
40.55    (cid:2)    15.93 (range of 18 – 84 years). Two hundred 
and  seventy-six  (79%)  participants  reported  having 
previous  treatment  experience  for  their  stuttering; 
however, only 52 participants (15%) reported being 
in treatment for stuttering at the time of the study.   

 Procedure 

 Details  of  the  procedure  used  in  this  study  can  be 
found in Boyle (2015b), but a brief summary is given 
here. The design of the study was a Web-based survey 
mode using Qualtrics software, distributed to Board 
Certiﬁ ed Specialists in Fluency Disorders in North 
America, as well as leaders of adult chapters of the 
National  Stuttering  Association  (NSA)  in  the  US. 
Three separate e-mails were sent to these individu-
als, one week apart from each other, requesting for 
them to forward the survey link to clients or group 
members who stutter. Ethical approval for the study 
was obtained by the institutional review board of the 
author ’ s institution and the NSA Research Commit-
tee. Participants were made aware that participation 
was  completely  voluntary  and  implied  consent  was 
indicated by completing the online questionnaire.   

 Self-report measures 

 Causal attributions were measured using an adapted 
version  of  the  Causal  Dimension  Scale  (CDS)  II 
(McAuley et   al., 1992). This scale asks participants 
to  give  their  opinions  about  the  cause  or  causes  of 
their performance in a given area. The CDS II pur-
ports to measure four different dimensions of attri-
butions on a 9-point, bipolar scale including:  locus of 
causality  ( α     (cid:3)    0.63) (e.g.  “ Is the cause something that 
reﬂ ects an aspect of yourself ”     (cid:3)    9 or  “ reﬂ ects aspect 
of the situation ”     (cid:3)    1);  external control  ( α     (cid:3)    0.77) (e.g. 
 “ Is the cause something over which others have con-
trol ”     (cid:3)    9 or  “ over which others have no control ”     (cid:3)    1); 
 stability  ( α     (cid:3)    0.53) (e.g.  “ Is the cause something that 
is permanent ”     (cid:3)    9 or  “ temporary ”     (cid:3)    1); and  personal 
control  ( α     (cid:3)    0.86) (e.g.  “ Is the cause something that 
you can regulate ”     (cid:3)    9 or  “ you cannot regulate ”     (cid:3)    1). 
Because the CSD II does not mention stuttering spe-
ciﬁ cally,  the  instructions  had  to  be  adapted  for  the 
participants of this study. The following instructions 
were given:  “ Imagine that you are speaking to some-
one and you begin to stutter and have difﬁ culty say-
ing what you want to say. The items below concern 
your impressions or opinions of the cause(s) of your 
stuttering in situations like this ” . 

in  general 

 Biological attributions were measured using the ques-
tion  “ To  what  extent  do  you  think  your  stuttering  in 
general is caused by biological factors (e.g. genes, brain 
abnormality,  etc.)? ”   Non-biological  attributions  were 
measured  with  the  question   “ To  what  extent  do  you 
is  caused  by 
think  your  stuttering 
non-biological factors (e.g. personality, stress, environ-
ment, emotional trauma, etc.)? ”  The response options 
for  these  questions  were  unipolar  1 – 9  point  scales 
(1    (cid:3)    not at all, 5    (cid:3)    moderately and 9    (cid:3)    very). These types 
of  questions  measuring  biological  and  non-biological 
attributions  have  been  used  in  previous  research  (e.g. 
R ü sch et   al., 2010). Self-stigma was measured using the 
 “ stigma application ”  sub-section of the Self-Stigma of 
Stuttering Scale (4S) (Boyle, 2013a, 2015b). This sec-
tion  of  the  scale  measures  the  extent  to  which  PWS 
internalise  negative  stigmatising  attitudes  and  apply 
them to themselves personally ( α     (cid:3)    0.90) (e.g.  “ Because 
I stutter I feel less capable than people who don ’ t stut-
ter ” ).  The  Generalized  Anxiety  Disorder  7-item 
(GAD-7)  Scale  (Spitzer,  Kroenke, Williams,   &   L ö we, 
2006)  was  used  to  assess  participants ’   presence  of 
indicating  generalised  anxiety  disorder 
symptoms 
( α     (cid:3)    0.91) (e.g.  “ Over the last 2 weeks, how often have 
you been bothered by the following problems? Feeling 
nervous,  anxious,  or  on  edge ” ).  The  Patient  Health 
 &  
Questionnaire  (PHQ-9)  (Kroenke,  Spitzer, 
Williams, 2001) was given to assess participants ’  depres-
sive symptoms ( α     (cid:3)    0.88) (e.g.  “ Over the last 2 weeks, 
how often have you been bothered by any of the following 
problems? Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless ” ). 

 The  Adult  Hope  Scale  (AHS)  (Snyder,  Harris, 
Anderson, Holleran, Irving, Sigmon, et   al., 1991) was 
used to assess participants ’  levels of hope ( α     (cid:3)    0.87). 
Speciﬁ cally, the scale taps into domains of agency (i.e. 
goal-directed energy) and pathways (i.e. planning to 
accomplish  the  goals).  An  example  item  is   “ Even 
when others get discouraged, I know I can ﬁ nd a way 
to  solve  the  problem ” .  The  self-esteem/self-efﬁ cacy 
sub-scale of the Empowerment Scale (Rogers, Cham-
berlin,  Ellison,   &   Crean,  1997)  was  used  to  assess 
( α     (cid:3)    0.89). 
participants ’  
self-esteem/self-efﬁ cacy 
Although  the  Empowerment  Scale  intends  to  mea-
sure  multiple  constructs  (e.g.  community  activism, 
righteous anger), only self-esteem/self-efﬁ cacy was of 
interest in this study. Therefore, the label  “ self-esteem-
self-efﬁ cacy ”  is used in this paper rather than  “ empow-
erment ” . An example item from this scale is  “ I have 
a positive attitude towards myself ” . Finally, self-rated 
speech disruption was assessed by asking participants 
to rate their typical stuttering severity in each of eight 
different  situations  (e.g.   “ Talking  with  a  stranger ” ). 
This self-rating scale for stuttering has been used in 
previous  research  studies  (O ’ Brian,  Jones,  Packman, 
Menzies,   &   Onslow,  2011).  It  was  speciﬁ ed  in  the 
instructions  that  “ stuttering  severity ”   referred  to  the 
 “  …  level of disruption in your speech that you think 
is noticeable on the surface for the majority of the day. 
It  does  not  refer  to  the  impact  of  the  disorder  as  a 
whole on your life ” .   

  Causal attributions for stuttering

 Data analysis 

 Internal consistency was calculated for all multi-item 
scales using Cronbach ’ s coefﬁ cient alpha (these were 
reported  in  the  previous  paragraphs  after  descrip-
tions  of  each  scale  used  in  the  study).  Means  and 
standard deviations were calculated for all study vari-
ables  of  interest.  Because  the  sample  varied  widely 
in terms of age, results were separated into speciﬁ c 
age  groups.  Then,  one-way  ANOVAs  with  Tukey 
HSD post-tests were conducted to see if there were 
signiﬁ cant differences in any of the variables across 
different age groups. For the primary analysis, zero-
order  Pearson  product  moment  correlations  were 
calculated between causal attribution variables (locus 
of causality, external control, stability, personal con-
trol,  biological  attributions,  non-biological  attribu-
tions)  and  scores  from  measures  of  psychological 
self-
well-being 
stigma, anxiety and depression). Because it was also 
of interest to determine if causal attribution variables 
were  signiﬁ cantly  related  to  well-being  variables, 
above and beyond self-rated speech disruption, par-
tial correlation coefﬁ cients were calculated between 
the  variables,  taking  into  account  self-rated  speech 
disruption of the participants.    

(self-esteem/self-efﬁ cacy,  hope, 

 Result 

 Item analysis was conducted on all of the multi-item 
scales used in the study. The Cronbach ’ s alpha coef-
ﬁ cients  reported  in  the  methods  section  for  each 
scale were mostly in the adequate to excellent range 
( (cid:4)    0.7) described by Nunnally (1978). However, two 
of the sub-scales (locus of causality and stability) had 
alpha coefﬁ cients less than 0.7 and, therefore, were 
considered to demonstrate less than adequate inter-
nal  consistency.  Because  of  this,  only  the  “ external 
control ”   and   “ personal  control ”   sub-scales  were 
analysed. Although the  “ stability ”  sub-scale demon-
strated  less  than  desirable  reliability,  it  was  still  of 
interest to examine how individual items in that sub-
scale correlated to the well-being variables of interest 
in the study. Therefore, two individual items: perma-
nent vs temporary (from now on this variable will be 
labelled 
 “ permanency ” )  and  unchangeable  vs 
changeable (from now on this variable will be labelled 
 “ unchangeableness ” ) were included separately in the 
statistical analyses of the study. 

 Table  I  displays  the  descriptive  statistics  for  all 
variables  of  interest  in  the  study  including  causal 
attribution variables (external control, personal con-
trol, permanency, unchangeableness, biological attri-
butions  and  non-biological  attributions)  and 
psychological well-being variables (self-stigma, anxi-
ety, depression, self-esteem/self-efﬁ cacy, hope) across 
different age groups. One-way ANOVAs with single 
step Tukey  HSD  post-hoc  tests  were  performed  to 
analyse if there were differences in any of the variables 
across  age  groups.  Participants  aged  65  and  above

reported signiﬁ cantly lower levels of generalised anx-
iety compared to participants in the 18 – 24 and 25 –
 34 age ranges and also signiﬁ cantly lower depressive 
symptoms than the 25 – 34 age group. Otherwise, no 
signiﬁ cant differences were found in the study vari-
ables across the different age groups. 

 Table II displays all of the zero-order correlations 
between attribution variables (external control, per-
sonal  control,  permanency  and  unchangeableness, 
biological  attributions,  non-biological  attributions) 
and  psychological  well-being  variables  (self-stigma, 
anxiety,  depression,  self-esteem/self-efﬁ cacy  and 
hope).  In  addition, Table  II  shows  partial  correla-
tions  between  these  variables,  controlling  for  self-
rated  speech  disruption.  Because  it  was  presumed 
that  speech  disruption  may  also  be  related  to  the 
psychological well-being variables of interest, it was 
desired to take this variable into account. It can be 
observed  from Table  II  that  the  more  the  cause  of 
stuttering  was  perceived  as  externally  controlled, 
higher anxiety and depression and lower self-esteem/
self-efﬁ cacy  and  hope  scores  were  reported.  Con-
versely,  the  more  the  cause  of  stuttering  was  per-
ceived  as  personally  controllable,  lower  ratings  of 
self-stigma  and  higher  levels  of  self-esteem/self-
efﬁ cacy and hope were reported. The more unchange-
able  the  cause  of  stuttering  was  perceived  to  be, 
higher ratings self-stigma and lower ratings of hope 
were reported. In addition, the more non-biological 
the cause of stuttering was perceived to be, the lower 
the levels of hope were reported. It is important to 
note  that  the  correlations  just  mentioned  were  sta-
tistically signiﬁ cant (ranging from small-to-medium 
effect  sizes),  even  taking  into  account  self-rated 
speech  disruption.  It  should  be  noted  that  higher 
biological  attributions  for  stuttering  were  signiﬁ -
cantly related to increased beliefs of stuttering per-
manency,  r     (cid:3)    0.24,  p     (cid:6)    0.001, increased beliefs in the 
unchangeableness  of  stuttering,   r     (cid:3)    0.17,   p     (cid:3)    0.003, 
and reduced beliefs in personal control of stuttering,

tions  were  signiﬁ cantly  related  to  increased  beliefs 
that the cause of stuttering is externally controlled, 
 r     (cid:3)    0.18,  p     (cid:3)    0.004. 

 Regarding the secondary research question of this 
study, as can be seen in Table II, higher self-ratings 
of  speech  disruption  were  associated  with  signiﬁ -
cantly lower personal control ratings and signiﬁ cantly 
higher  ratings  of  external  control,  permanency  and 
unchangeableness.   

 Discussion 

 The purpose of this study was to examine relation-
ships between causal attributions (external control, 
personal  control,  permanency  and  unchangeable-
ness,  biological  attribution,  non-biological  attribu-
tion)  and  psychological  well-being  (self-stigma, 
anxiety,  depression,  self-esteem/self-efﬁ cacy  and 
hope)  in  adults  who  stutter.  The  results  provide 
empirical  support  for  the  notion  that  PWS  who 
make causal attributions for stuttering that are more 
external (i.e. under the power and control of other 
people) report greater levels of anxiety and depres-
sion and lower levels of self-esteem/self-efﬁ cacy and 
hope, independent of their self-rated speech disrup-
tion.  On  the  other  hand,  adults  who  stutter  who 
believe  that  the  causes  of  stuttering  are  more  per-
sonally controllable (i.e. over which they have power 
and  can  regulate  and  manage)  are  more  likely  to 
experience greater levels of self-esteem/self-efﬁ cacy 
and hope and lower levels of self-stigma. These ﬁ nd-
ings differ from those of Mak and Wu (2006), who 
found that increased personal attributions for men-
tal  illness  were  related  to  diminished  levels  of  self-
worth. Perhaps these discrepancies can be explained 
by the fact that those authors used a different mea-
sure  of  stigma  than  was  used  in  the  current  study. 
Those  authors  also  created  the  stigma  scale  them-
selves  but  did  not  describe  the  items  or  what  they 
included  in  that  measure.  Also,  it  is  possible  that

individuals who stutter perceive personal control of 
their  condition  differently  than  individuals  with 
mental illness. 

 The ﬁ ndings of this study seem to support previous 
research ﬁ ndings that self-efﬁ cacy (i.e. people ’ s beliefs 
about their ability to manage something or achieve a 
certain outcome) is related to psychological resilience 
and functions to buffer the negative impacts of stut-
tering (Craig et   al., 2011). Self-efﬁ cacy has also been 
found  to  be  a  predictor  of  quality-of-life  in  PWS, 
above and beyond severity of physical speech disrup-
tion  (Boyle,  2015a). The  current  ﬁ ndings  also  sup-
port the conclusions of Lee et   al. (2011) that increased 
feelings of personal control are related to lower neg-
ative life impact of stuttering. The current and previ-
ous research ﬁ ndings demonstrate the importance of 
instilling  a  sense  of  personal  control  in  the  PWS 
regarding their stuttering. 

 It is important to note that, recently, the idea that 
discussing the biological nature (e.g. genetic contri-
butions)  of  stuttering  with  parents  of  children  who 
stutter has been recommended for reducing the guilt 
and emotional burden they experience if they believe 
that  their  behaviour  caused  the  disorder  (Kraft   &  
Yairi, 2012). Although that is certainly a valid point, 
the  current  results  show  that,  among  PWS  them-
selves,  increased  biological  attributions  about  the 
cause  of  stuttering  were  linked  to  lower  ratings  for 
personal  control  of  stuttering  and  increased  beliefs 
that the causes of stuttering were permanent and less 
amenable  to  change. Therefore,  it  is  possible  that, 
although discussing these biological aspects of stut-
tering could lead to fewer feelings of guilt or blame, 
it  could  lead  to  increased  perceptions  of  stuttering 
being  uncontrollable.  Still,  the  fact  remains  that 
current  evidence  indicates  a  strong  biological  and 
neurodevelopmental  component  to  stuttering  (Beal 
et   al., 2013). It seems important, then, to communi-
cate to PWS and family members that, even though 
current evidence on stuttering suggests a strong bio-
logical  causal  component,  PWS  can  learn  to  have 
increased  feelings  of  control  over  their  speech  with 
therapy. It needs to be emphasised that biology is not 
destiny  and,  speciﬁ cally,  that  the  concepts  of  bio-
logical causes of stuttering and the possibility of feel-
ing  in  greater  control  of  speech  production  are  not 
necessarily in conﬂ ict. It should be noted that  “ con-
trol ” ,  as  it  is  being  used  here,  does  not  necessarily 
mean complete ﬂ uency, but could also refer to mod-
iﬁ cation of stuttering moments. 

 Finally, the ﬁ ndings that reduced self-rated speech 
disruption was related to increased ratings of personal 
control and lower ratings of external control, perma-
nency of stuttering and unchangeableness of stutter-
ing  support  the  notion  that  establishing  a  sense  of 
increased  control  in  PWS  can  be  beneﬁ cial  in  the 
speech domain as well as in the psychological domain. 
The notion that stuttering results from something that 
a  PWS  does,  rather  than  something  that   “ just  hap-
pens ” ,  was  promoted  by Williams  (1957). Although 

Williams ’   belief  that  PWS  are  not  neuro-physiologi-
cally  distinct  from  people  who  do  not  stutter  is  not 
supported by current research, the notion that PWS 
are not helpless to manipulate and modify their speech 
is important to convey to clients who stutter. Even if 
stuttering is not entirely in the control of a PWS, how 
a person responds to stuttering certainly is. According 
to the current ﬁ ndings, feeling that one has some con-
trol  over  a  disorder  characterised  by  loss  of  control 
seems  to  be  relevant  for  increased  well-being  and 
reduced speech disruption. 

 This study is limited in that only a few measures 
of well-being were included. For example, measures 
such as guilt or shame might be important to mea-
sure in the future in relation to beliefs about causal 
attributions of stuttering. It is possible that, if a PWS 
believes  that  he  or  she  is  more  responsible  for  the 
cause  of  stuttering,  more  guilt  or  shame  is  experi-
enced.  Another  limitation  of  the  study  is  that  the 
measures used do not allow for a detailed analysis of 
what  participants ’   believed  they  would  be  able  to 
control regarding their stuttering. For example, hav-
ing  personal  control  over  the  cause  of  stuttering 
could potentially have different meanings to different 
people, including being able to produce ﬂ uent speech 
when  desired,  being  able  to  modify  a  stuttering 
moment to be less tense, or perhaps even controlling 
a  psychological  frame  of  mind  when  speaking  with 
others. Unfortunately it is not able to be determined 
with the current data what particular aspects of stut-
tering  participants  believed  could  be  controlled. 
More  detailed  analysis  including  speciﬁ c  descrip-
tions  of  different  behaviours  (e.g.  ﬂ uency  shaping, 
stuttering  modiﬁ cation)  and  their  relation  to  well-
being should be investigated in future studies. It will 
also be helpful to utilise qualitative methods to inves-
tigate these constructs in more detail. Finally, as with 
many online surveys, it is not possible to calculate a 
response rate because it is not known precisely how 
many people had access to the survey link. Therefore, 
the respondents may not have been representative of 
the  population  of  PWS  as  a  whole.  In  particular, 
many participants were recruited from therapists and 
self-help  support  groups,  therefore  increasing  the 
odds that PWS who have sought help for stuttering 
were  over-represented.  Despite  this  limitation,  only 
15% of the sample was receiving therapy for stutter-
ing during the time the study was conducted. Also, 
studies  have  shown  that  members  of  the  NSA  are 
quite diverse in terms of their beliefs and experiences 
(Yaruss,  Quesal,   &   Murphy,  2002).  These  factors 
should decrease concerns that the sample was overly 
biased;  however,  future  studies  should  attempt  to 
include an even broader range of PWS. Finally, this 
study  is  correlational  in  nature  and  causal  claims 
between the variables cannot be made. 

 Despite these limitations, it can be concluded with 
conﬁ dence that the psychological perception of hav-
ing some personal control over the cause of stuttering 
is related to higher levels of psychological well-being 

and  lower  levels  of  speech  disruption. Therefore,  if 
speech-language pathologists aim to improve psycho-
logical  well-being  and  reduce  speech  disruption  of 
PWS  as  a  part  of  intervention,  it  could  be  relevant 
during  assessment  and  treatment  to  consider  how 
much  personal  power  or  control  they  feel  that  they 
possess over the causes of their speech production and 
the extent to which they perceive the causes of stut-
tering  to  be   “ under  the  power  of  other  people ”   or 
other external variables. Even if total ﬂ uency cannot 
be  achieved,  which  is  very  common,  especially  in 
adults,  it  could  be  the  case  that  teaching  PWS  to 
respond to moments of stuttering and feelings of loss 
of  control  in  more  adaptive  ways  (e.g.  being  able  to 
respond  to  moments  of  stuttering  with  less  tension 
and struggle), could be very beneﬁ cial psychologically 
as well as motorically. Clients would likely also ben-
eﬁ t from increased knowledge about the typical speech 
production process and how speech can be disrupted. 
This type of knowledge could enhance clients ’  percep-
tions  of  personal  control  regarding  their  ability  to 
manipulate  their  speech  mechanism.  Finally,  clients 
who  stutter  should  be  informed  that,  although  the 
disorder of stuttering has biological origins, much can 
be done in therapy to improve their ability to modify 
their speech production and increase their feelings of 
control over speech production if desired.
