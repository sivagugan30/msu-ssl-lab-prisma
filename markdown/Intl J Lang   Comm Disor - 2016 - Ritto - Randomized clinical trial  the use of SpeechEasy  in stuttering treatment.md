Abstract

Background: Numerous studies have demonstrated the beneﬁt of devices delivering altered auditory feedback (AAF)
as a therapeutic alternative for those who stutter.
Aims: The effectiveness of a device delivering AAF (SpeechEasy R(cid:2)) was compared with behavioural techniques in
the treatment of stuttering in a randomized clinical trial.
Methods & Procedures: Two groups of adults who stutter participated: group 1 consisted of 10 men and one woman
aged 21–42 years (mean = 30.0). Group 2 consisted of six men and one woman aged 20–50 years (mean =
35.6). Participants in group 1 were ﬁt with a SpeechEasy R(cid:2) device and were not given any additional training (i.e.,
supplementary ﬂuency enhancing techniques). Participants used the device daily for 6 months. Participants in
group 2 received treatment in the form of a 12-week ﬂuency promotion protocol with techniques based on both
ﬂuency shaping and stuttering modiﬁcation.
Outcomes & Results: There were no statistically signiﬁcant differences (p > .05) between groups in participants’
stuttered syllables following treatment. That is, both therapeutic protocols achieved approximately 40% reduction
in number of stuttered syllables from baseline measures, with no signiﬁcant relapse after 3 or 6 months post-
treatment.
Conclusions & Implications: The results suggest that the SpeechEasy R(cid:2) device can be a viable option for the treatment
of stuttering.

Keywords: stuttering, therapy, altered auditory feedback.

What this paper adds?
What is already known on the subject?
Previous studies on AAF agree that these devices can decrease the number of stuttering events without changing the
naturalness characteristics of speech production, such as speech rate, intensity or fundamental frequency. However,
substantial variability is found across studies regarding degree and pattern of beneﬁt. The majority of previous studies
about AAF utilized laboratory conditions.

What this study adds?
There were no statistically signiﬁcant differences between the therapy protocols (behavioural versus AAF) in par-
ticipants’ stuttered syllables following treatment; both achieved an approximately 40% reduction in the number of
stuttered syllables from baseline measures, with no signiﬁcant relapse after 3 or 6 months post-treatment. The results
suggest that altered auditory devices can be a viable clinical option for those who stutter, especially when used in
combination with therapeutic techniques.

Introduction

Stuttering is a speech disorder characterized by invol-
untary speech disruptions, which typically include part-
word (i.e., sound or syllable) repetitions, sound pro-
longations and blocks (postural ﬁxations). Secondary
behaviours such as head jerking, blinking, facial gri-
macing, ﬁsts clenching, among other manifestations of
struggle behaviour, may also accompany these primary
speech disruptions (Bloodstein and Bernstein-Ratner
2007).

The most accepted treatments for stuttering are
based in ﬂuency shaping and/or stuttering modiﬁcation
techniques (Bloodstein and Bernstein-Ratner 2007).
Despite the theoretical differences between the ap-
proaches, each employs behavioural modiﬁcations of
speech patterns. Extended vowel duration, gentle vowel
onsets, continuous voicing and continuous airﬂow are
advocated for ﬂuency shaping, while pull-outs, cancel-
lations and preparatory sets are promoted for stuttering
modiﬁcation. In other words, the traditional treatments
for stuttering aim to inhibit or diminish stuttering be-
haviour by implementing motoric changes in speech
production. Validation for the short- and long-term ef-
fectiveness of behavioural stuttering therapy on reducing
the stuttering frequency can be found in the literature
(e.g., Herder et al. 2006).

Unfortunately, however, clients often offer some crit-
icism to these therapeutic programmes’ outcomes. The
most common concern is that the post-treatment speech
may sound and feel unnatural to the person who stut-
ters and to listeners (Kalinowski et al. 1994, Stuart and
Kalinowski 2004). In addition, maintaining the novel
speech patterns often require a voluntary effort and at-
tention to speech during everyday conversations that
may lead to relapse (Bloodstein and Bernstein-Ratner
2007).

Another means of treating stuttering is with the
use of altered auditory feedback (AAF), i.e., the use
of a digital signal processor to produce a second altered
signal using one’s own speech, delivered back to the
speaker temporally and/or spectrally altered. Two exam-
ples of these signals are delayed auditory feedback (DAF)
and frequency-altered auditory feedback (FAF). Stutter-
ing frequency has been reported to be signiﬁcantly de-
creased during conditions of AAF even when at a fast
rate of speech (Kalinowski et al. 1993), monaurally pre-
sented (Stuart et al. 1997) and regardless of audience size
(Armson et al. 1997). The positive effect of AAF in re-
ducing stuttering has led to the development of self-
contained devices delivering AAF for an alternative or
adjunct to traditional therapy for those who stutter. To
date, numerous studies have demonstrated the beneﬁt
of devices delivering AAF as a therapeutic alternative;
however, substantial variability is found regarding de-

Ana Paula Ritto et al.

gree and pattern of beneﬁt (e.g., Armson et al. 2006,
Gallop and Runyan (2012), Stuart et al. 2004, 2006).

Considering long-term studies about the effect of
AAF devices, Van Borsel et al. (2003) reported the
effect of repeated exposure to a DAF device in the
speech of nine persons who stutter during a 3-month
period outside a clinical environment with only mini-
mal clinical guidance. Their results indicate that DAF
was an effective means of reducing stuttering even when
used over a long period. Stuart et al. also demonstrated
two long-term studies: a 4-month treatment follow-up
(Stuart et al. 2004) and a 1-year follow-up (Stuart et al.
2006). Both of them investigated the long-term out-
come of stuttering treatment using SpeechEasy R(cid:2). In
the ﬁrst study, stuttering rate was found to be signiﬁ-
cantly reduced with the device in place and remained so
4 months later, with no signiﬁcant difference between
the naturalness of speech ratings. The second study re-
sults indicate that the proportion of stuttering events
remained signiﬁcantly reduced at 12 months follow-up.
Gallop and Runyan 2012 examined the long-term ef-
fectiveness of the SpeechEasy R(cid:2) for longer periods of
time, up to 13 months. Results indicated no signiﬁ-
cant changes over time. There appear to be a signiﬁcant
generalized decline in stuttering frequency, or carryover
effect, which occurs when comparing the baseline stut-
tering frequency pretreatment with the post-treatment
stuttering frequency when the device was taken out.
Simply put, wearing the AAF device reduced baseline
stuttering over time.

The purpose of this research was to develop a ran-
domized treatment clinical trial in order to verify the
efﬁcacy of the SpeechEasy R(cid:2) on the treatment of stut-
tering. Previous research was conﬁned mostly to exper-
iments conducted in laboratories or experiments only
approaching the AAF effect. Therefore, the need for
further investigation was warranted. The clinical trial
aims to investigate the effectiveness of the SpeechEasy R(cid:2)
device and to monitor possible adverse effects in or-
der to help the clinician to indicate stuttering treatment
options in a safe and accurate way. This study was char-
acterized as Phase III, aiming to perform a between-
treatment comparison: SpeechEasy R(cid:2) versus traditional
behavioural treatment. For this study, a positive treat-
ment effect is understood as the manifestation of pos-
itive changes in ﬂuency resulting from treatment (i.e.,
reduced frequency of stuttered syllables).

Method

Participants

Participants were 18 adult normal-hearing native speak-
ers of Brazilian Portuguese who stutter. They were diag-
nosed with at least ‘moderate’ stuttering as assessed with

the Stuttering Severity Instrument—3 (Riley 1994). All
had a negative history of other communication disorders
and were diagnosed with neurological and/or degener-
ative diseases. The participants were randomly assigned
to different treatment groups. Group 1 consisted of
11 adults who stutter including 10 men and one woman
aged 21–42 years (mean = 30.0). Group 2 consisted of
seven adults who stutter including six men and one
woman aged 20–50 years (mean = 35.6). The mean
Stuttering Severity Instrument—3 scores were 28.0
(SE = 1.7) and 26.7 (SE = 4.6) for groups 1 and 2,
respectively. The difference between Stuttering Sever-
ity Instrument—3 scores was not statistically signiﬁcant
(t[16] = 0.26, p = .80, η2
p

= .006).

Procedure

This study received prior approval of School of Medicine
at University of S˜ao Paulo Ethics Committee (CEP-
FMUSP 116/11) and informed consent was obtained
from all participants. The participants were recruited
at the Department of Physiotherapy, Speech–Language
and Hearing Sciences and Occupational Therapy,
School of Medicine, University of S˜ao Paulo (Sao Paulo,
Brazil).

Baseline testing

For baseline evaluation, speech samples of each par-
ticipant were videotaped, using a Sony R(cid:2) DRC-SR62
video camera, in three different conditions (i.e., mono-
logue speech, conversational speech and oral reading).
For the monologue task, participants were instructed to
discuss a topic of their choice. The evaluator suggested
some topics, such as family, sports, hobbies, ﬁlms, tele-
vision, etc., prior to the testing. For the conversation
task, the evaluator used some prompt questions adapted
from The Memory Box discussion cards (Dynes 2006)
to initiate the dialogue. For the oral reading task, the
participants read different texts with similar theme and
syntactic complexity. The reading was performed solo
(i.e., the participant was the only one reading out loud).
During the testing, participants of group 1 used the
SpeechEasy R(cid:2) device. For control purposes, speech sam-
ples from the same participants without the device were
also gathered.

Group 1 treatment

The group 1 participants were asked to use a
SpeechEasy R(cid:2) device for a 6-month period, with no
training to use any ﬂuency enhancing techniques.
After baseline testing, completely-in-the-canal shells
were custom-made for each participant’s right ear. The
SpeechEasy R(cid:2) devices were programmed with a delay

771

of 60 ms combined with a frequency shift of plus
500 Hz, using the SpeechMaster R(cid:2) software, installed in
the same Sony R(cid:2) VPC-AS laptop, and the AudioPro R(cid:2)
Plus hardware interface. Volume was adjusted according
to the preference of each participant. The only orien-
tations offered to the participants were those related to
maintenance and keeping of the device; in other words,
they were just given the device to use, with no thera-
peutic techniques. The goal was to investigate only the
effect of the AAF device.

Each participant of this group signed a loaning con-
tract, assuming the responsibility for the safe keeping of
the device during the period of the study. The partici-
pants also committed to use the device daily in all situ-
ations involving interpersonal communication, at least
for 6 h per day. For all these participants, the possibility
of receiving the device for no ﬁnancial cost at the end
of the study was granted, if it leads to improvement in
their speech. Participants were offered the option of be-
havioural therapy, if wanted, after the end of the study.

Group 2 treatment

After baseline speech testing, participants of group 2 un-
derwent a ﬂuency treatment protocol (Andrade 2003).
The protocol consisted of a 12-week module (i.e.,
12 weekly 50-min sessions) during which participants
received individual ﬂuency treatment
followed by
assigned activities to be completed by each participant
at home. Emphasis was placed on the acquisition of a
series of speech targets, which included: soft articulatory
contacts, gentle speech onsets and blending. For this
purpose, speciﬁc ﬂuency promotion techniques were
used, combining both ﬂuency shaping and stuttering
modiﬁcation techniques—negative practice, smooth
speech, resisting time pressure and use of voluntary
disﬂuencies. In addition to the practice of these speech
motor skills, the treatment programme emphasized
self-observation and included systematic cognitive and
attitudinal
intervention. All participants committed
to daily practice with their new ﬂuent speech skills, in
all situations involving interpersonal communication.
Participants who had three or more absences during the
treatment were discontinued from this research.

Monitoring testing

All participants underwent three monitoring testing that
followed the exact same procedure as the baseline evalu-
ation. For group 1, the samples were collected after the
SpeechEasy R(cid:2) ﬁtting (immediately after baseline evalua-
tion) and at 3 and 6 months post-SpeechEasy R(cid:2) ﬁtting.
For group 2, the samples were collected at the end of
the treatment (i.e., 3 months after baseline evaluation),
and at 3 and 6 months post-treatment.

Speech analysis

The speech samples from all participants were randomly
assigned to two certiﬁed speech–language pathologists,
trained in the ﬁeld of stuttering, but not involved in the
therapeutic process. They had no knowledge to which
group each participant belonged. The ﬁrst 200 syllables
produced by the participants in each condition were
analyzed, using a Sony R(cid:2) VPC-AS laptop and Maxwell R(cid:2)
HP200F headphones. Orthographic transcriptions were
carried out, and the stuttering episodes were marked and
counted. Stuttering episodes were identiﬁed using as per
the Stuttering Severity Instrument—3 (Riley 1994).

Results

The means and standard errors for a number of stut-
tered syllables in the 200 syllables samples as a function
of group, task (i.e., monologue, conversation and read-
ing), and time (i.e., baseline, initial, 3 and 6 months) are
presented in table 1. The means and standard errors for
proportion of stuttered syllables in the 200 syllables sam-
ples as a function of group, task and time are presented
in ﬁgure 1. A three-factor linear mixed model analysis of
variance (IBM SPSS Statistics For Mac 22.0.0.1) with
repeated measures was performed to determine the effect

of group, task and time on stuttered syllables. This anal-
ysis is appropriate as it can accommodate missing data
in a repeated measures design (Little and Rubin 2002).
The repeated measures were modelled with a com-
pound symmetry covariance metric. The participants’
proportional scores were transformed to arcsine units
prior to subjecting them to inferential statistical analy-
sis. The summary of the analysis is presented in table 2.
As is evident, only a main effect of time was found

(p < .0001) and all other main effects and interactions
were not statistically signiﬁcant (p > .05). To exam-
ine the main effect of time, least signiﬁcant difference
pairwise comparisons (adjusted for multiple compar-
isons) were used to examine differences on the esti-
mated marginal means of stuttered syllables for base-
line, initial, 3 and 6 months’ test times. It was found
that the baseline evidenced signiﬁcantly more stuttered
syllables relative to the initial, 3 and 6 months’ test times
(p < .01). There were also no statistically signiﬁcant dif-
ferences between stuttered syllables for initial, 3 and 6
months’ test times (p > .05). In other words, the num-
ber of stuttered syllables was signiﬁcantly reduced in all
post-treatment measures when compared with baseline,
regardless of group or task.

Discussion

For this study, there was no difference between the
outcomes of behavioural therapy and the treatment us-
ing the SpeechEasy R(cid:2) device. Both therapeutic protocols
achieved approximately 40% reduction in the number of
stuttered syllables from baseline measures, regardless of
task, with no signiﬁcant relapse after 3 or 6 months post-
treatment. These results are similar to those reported by
Armson et al. (2006).

The results of group 1 for monologue suggest a
decline in SpeechEasy R(cid:2) effectiveness over time, even
though there is no signiﬁcant difference. The lack of
signiﬁcant difference implies that the effectiveness of
the device has been maintained over time, but maybe a
larger sample would show different results.

One needs to acknowledge that the therapy results
were reached after 12 weekly sessions with daily practice,
while SpeechEasy R(cid:2) results were reached immediately
after the device ﬁtting with no behavioural strategies.
While in the behavioural therapy group all participants
had speech improvements, in different degrees; however,
concerning SpeechEasy R(cid:2), one participant appeared to
receive no beneﬁts at all, leading to the conclusion that
some people are less susceptible to passive inhibition
of stuttering via the auditory feedback. The settings of

773

DAF and FAF were kept constant for all participants, set
to the default settings from Janus Development Group
Inc. Perhaps individualized custom settings could lead
to better results, especially for the most severe stutters.
Signiﬁcant reductions in stuttering were achieved,
however, upon completion of both protocols, substan-
tial levels of stuttering remained. These results may be
explained by the fact that the participants were all mod-
erate to very severe chronic stutterers, and the majority
of them reported history of therapy. A smaller magni-
tude of improvements in speech ﬂuency was found in
this study than was previously reported (e.g., Van Borsel
et al. 2003, Stuart et al. 2004). This may be explained by
the absence of the active techniques used in the typical
use of SpeechEasy R(cid:2), suggest by training manual (2006),
such as deliberately prolonging the starter sounds, and
continuous prolongation. Those protocols were not fol-
lowed in this study in an attempt to isolate the effect of
the device. But different from true choral signal, AAF
requires speech to be initiated by the speaker and ‘fed
back’ before it can inhibit stuttering; that means that
AAF cannot be experienced during a silent block (Stu-
art et al. 2008), possibly causing the higher number of
stuttered syllables indicated in the results.

Conclusions

Results of this study suggest that AAF devices can be a
viable clinical option for those who stutter. When used
in combination with therapeutic techniques, especially
those that work with speech initiation (e.g., gentle on-
sets), the therapeutic effects may be enhanced. The re-
sults obtained with this study pointed future directions
for our research, emphasizing the need to assess natural-
ness of speech and quality of life after both treatments
modalities and, ﬁnally, provide a treatment combining
AAF and therapy and compare the results obtained in
this group with the results in this paper.
