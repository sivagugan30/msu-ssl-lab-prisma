ABSTRACT
Purpose: The aim of this series of case studies was to determine (1) the impact of the Lidcombe
Program on early stuttering in Arabic-speaking preschool children, (2) whether adaptations are
necessary when implementing the treatment program in Kuwait, and (3) the opinions of Arab
parents about the treatment program.
Method: This paper reports case studies of six Kuwaiti preschool age children who stuttered,
aged 4;9–5;11 years (median 5;3 years), and were treated with the Lidcombe Program. The
treatment program was administered in Arabic. The outcome measures included percentage
of syllables stuttered (%SS) and severity ratings (SR), treatment times, and parent report.
Results: Four children completed both stages of the treatment program. Significant changes in
the speech of all four children were noted, reaching below 1.0%SS. The treatment was
completed in a median of 10.5, 1-hour clinic sessions, and a median of 136.5 days from
commencement of the treatment program.
Conclusion: Findings suggest that this Western program is applicable and effective with a
Kuwaiti population when presented in Arabic.

1. Introduction

Stuttering exists in every race, culture and language
and among both monolingual and bilingual speakers
(Finn & Cordes, 1997; Van Borsel, Maes, & Foulon,
2001). To date, however, only limited knowledge is
available to assist with implementing stuttering treat-
ment programs for culturally and linguistically diverse
societies. The focus of research has predominantly
been on Western cultures and societies, as a result
little is known about the treatment of stuttering in
Arab societies and the impact of culture. There are
several issues that need to be considered and funda-
mental gaps in research that require more attention
in order to be able to approach the disorder of stutter-
ing from a multicultural perspective (Finn & Cordes,
1997). The current study involves the implementation
of
the Lidcombe Program, an early intervention
program that has been widely investigated and
the benefits of early intervention

Gottwald, & Halfond, 1990; Wakaba, 1983). The appar-
ent successes of these therapies with young children
who stutter (CWS) indicates that early childhood stut-
tering is highly amenable to treatment (Onslow &
Packman, 1999). However, the most extensively inves-
tigated treatment to date is the Lidcombe Program
(Onslow et al., 1990). Details about the Lidcombe
Program can be found at http://www.fhs.usyd.edu.
au/asrc and in Onslow et al. (2003) and Jones et al.
(2005).

The Lidcombe Program is an operant, parent-con-
ducted intervention and has been the subject of inten-
sive research (de Sonneville-Koedoot, Stolk, Rietveld,
Franken, & Walker, 2015; Harris et al., 2002; Jones
et al., 2000; Lincoln & Onslow, 1997; Onslow et al.,
1994; Onslow et al., 1990; Onslow et al., 2003). It is
the only treatment program to date that has been
II and III clinical trials (Jones
studied with Phase I,
et al., 2005; Lewis, Packman, Onslow, Simpson, &
Jones, 2008; Onslow et al., 2003). Treatment studies
have shown that the time taken to reduce stuttering
to near zero levels and to complete Stage 1 varies
around a median of 11 clinic visits (Jones et al., 2000;
Kingston, Huber, Onslow, Jones, & Packman, 2003),
with 90% of children completing Stage 1 in 22 visits.
Some studies have also found that children with
more severe stuttering took longer
to complete
Stage1 (Jones et al., 2000; Kingston et al., 2003).
Studies have also established that the program is
able to reduce stuttering rates beyond that of natural
recovery over a 3-month period (Harris et al., 2002)
and also in the longer term. This suggests that the
program not only reduces stuttering but can also
stop the progress of the disorder altogether, with
fluency gains maintained in the long term for some
children (Harris et al., 2002; Jones et al., 2005; Onslow
et al., 2003). The long-term impact of the Lidcombe
Program has been shown to be significant up to 18
months post-treatment (de Sonneville-Koedoot et al.,
2015; Jones et al., 2008). Furthermore, substantial
long-term changes have been observed one year
post-treatment, among preschoolers who stuttered,
even when treatment was administered by SLPs
newly trained in the Lidcombe program (Miller &
Guitar, 2009).

Furthermore, several treatment studies of the Lid-
combe Program have been conducted in multicultural
Western societies, with reports of the program being
used in countries like Australia, U.K, US, South Africa,
Canada, New Zealand and the Netherlands (de Sonne-
ville-Koedoot et al., 2015; Franken, Kielstra-Van der
Schalk, & Boelens, 2005; Jones et al., 2000, 2005; King-
ston et al., 2003; Lewis et al., 2008). Many of the
countries that have taken on board this program are
considered multicultural and multilingual and while
they reported that cultural sensitivity is vital when
working with families of children who stutter (CWS),

research demonstrates that the program is in fact
effective.

1.2. Using the Lidcombe Program with bilingual
and monolingual children who stutter in
different languages

Several studies have investigated the effectiveness of
the Lidcombe Program with bilingual speakers who
stutter from different cultures, speaking languages
other than English. The translatability of the program
is primarily because parents deliver the treatment in
the child’s natural everyday environment and they
are encouraged to deliver it according to cultural and
family traditions. Outcomes suggest that the program
is effective with bilingual CWS in a variety of cultures,
and when conducted bilingually in languages such as
in
Baluchi and Persian (Bakhtiar & Packman, 2009),
English and Arabic and English and French (Gutmann
& Shenker, 2006; Harrison, Bruce, Shenker, & Koushik,
2010; Roberts & Shenker, 2007). It also appears that
the Lidcombe program delivered in one language will
generalize
second
language (Roberts & Shenker, 2007; Rousseau,
Packman, & Onslow, 2004; Shenker, Courcy, Gingras,
& Polomeno, 1997). Other studies report on the use
of the program in languages other than English, includ-
ing French (Rousseau et al., 2004), and Arabic (Abou El-
Ella, Saleh, Shoeib, Ghandour, & Mohammed, 2006;
Rifaie, Hasan, Saber, & Kaddah, 2009) with evidence
of its effectiveness.

treatment outcomes

to the

In a case study by Bakhtiar and Packman (2009), an
8;11 year old bilingual Iranian boy was treated with the
Lidcombe Program. The child spoke Baluchi (L1) and
Persian (L2) and treatment was conducted in both
languages. The child completed Stage 1, reaching
near 0%SS after 13 weeks and 12 clinic visits,
suggesting that the Lidcombe Program may be effec-
tive in a non-western culture and in a language other
than English. Similarly, in a case study by Roberts and
Shenker (2007), a bilingual 6 –year old child was
treated in both English and Arabic over the course of
one month. The parents of the child implemented
the program using both English and Arabic.
It was

found that the program was successful

SS and 0.9%SS respectively).

There have been far fewer studies conducted on the
use of the treatment program in monolingual Arabic
speaking preschool CWS and their families. An earlier
study by Abou El-Ella and colleagues compared the
use of the Lidcombe Program versus a family counsel-
ing approach with Egyptian children, with significant
improvement noted with the Lidcombe Program
group (Abou El-Ella et al., 2006). Similarly, a study by
Rifaie et al. (2009) used the Lidcombe Program with
10 preschool-age Saudi children, and the treatment

program was again conducted in Arabic. Rifaie et al.
also reported that the program was effective in redu-
cing stuttering, which was evident in the reduction in
percent stuttered words (%SW) and severity ratings
(SR) taken by parents. The program was also found to
be informative for parents, teaching them about stut-
tering, which ultimately motivated their continuation
of the program.

reports have also established that

At this time however, the results of these studies
several
should be interpreted with caution for
reasons; the number of children who participated in
both studies is small. Furthermore,
is unclear
whether these clinicians were SLPs, or whether they
had formal training in administering the Lidcombe
Program. Finally, some cultural differences among
Arab countries exists and therefore generalizing
results to other countries like Kuwait must be done
prudently.

the
median treatment time to reach Stage 2 of the Lid-
combe Program for monolingual and bilingual CWS is
between 9 and 11 sessions (Findlay, Shenker, & Mat-
thews, 2008; Jones et al., 2000; Kingston et al., 2003),
consistent with findings from studies on monolingual
CWS, which report a median treatment time of 11 ses-
sions (Jones et al., 2000; Kingston et al., 2003; Koushik,
Hewat, Shenker, Jones, & Onslow, 2010). Furthermore,
research findings also indicate that early bilingualism,
which is when a child is introduced to a second
language before the age of 4 years, does not affect
treatment time with the Lidcombe Program (Shenker,
Conte, Gingras, Courcy, & Polomeno, 1998).

This plethora of findings suggests promising results
regardless of whether the Lidcombe Program is used
with monolinguals, bilinguals or in languages other
than English. There are also promising findings when
implementing the treatment program in different cul-
tures (Abou El-Ella et al., 2006; Bakhtiar & Packman,
2009; Rifaie et al., 2009). Due to the increasing popular-
ity of the program worldwide, the Lidcombe Program
languages
manual has been translated into several
including Arabic, Dutch, French, German,
Italian,
Persian and Spanish.

1.3. Early stuttering intervention services in
Kuwait

Anecdotal reports indicate that there are approxi-
mately fewer than 100 Kuwaiti Speech-Language Path-
ologists (SLPs), with a smaller number of non-Kuwaiti
SLPs currently, working in Kuwait. These SLPs work
across all sectors in Kuwait including government and
private schools, as well as in government and private
health care centers and hospitals. Graduates from
Kuwait University, Department of Communication Dis-
orders Sciences, previously completed 4 years (8 full
semesters) in order to graduate with a Bachelor of

Science in Communication Disorders. A current modifi-
cation to the curriculum now requires that students’
complete 9 semesters, which is approximately 4–5
years.

Despite the extensive literature about the impor-
tance of early intervention programs such as the Lid-
in Arab countries,
combe Program, many SLPs
including Kuwait, appear to lack awareness and knowl-
edge of this program (Al-Khaledi, Lincoln, McCabe, &
Alshatti, 2014). Anecdotally, we know that in Kuwait
the treatment of preschool stuttering is generally in
the form of take-home guidelines for parents, covering
aspects such as environmental modification and mod-
eling as well as the ‘Do’s and Don’ts’ of managing early
stuttering. Initial therapy sessions often involve coun-
seling both parents, and the child if he/she is older,
regarding their feelings towards the stuttering. The
‘wait and see’ period is usually 3 months or until no
or little improvement is noted. If the stuttering persists
and is found to be severe, fluency shaping techniques,
stuttering modification or an integrated approach is
used with CWS.

1.4. The current study

The current study is a preliminary case study report on
the Lidcombe Program, aimed at determining the
effectiveness and applicability of the Western treat-
ment program in Arabic within another Arab country,
Kuwait. The standard 2008 version of the Lidcombe
Program was delivered to Kuwaiti preschool age chil-
dren and their parents using the Kuwaiti dialect.
Ethical clearance was granted for conducting the
study at a government clinic, the Shaikh Salem Al-Ali
Speech and Audiology clinic, which is run under the
Ministry of Health in Kuwait. A case study method
was used so that any alterations deemed necessary
to the standard delivery of the program could be docu-
mented and evaluated. The distinctive contribution of
this study is its focus on treatment for early stuttering
in Kuwait. This has not been studied in the past.
Before commencing widespread treatment services
using Western approaches, such as the Lidcombe
Program for early stuttering intervention, it is impera-
tive to first trial these approaches and determine
whether they achieve similar results, whether they
require adaptation and/or whether there are barriers
to implementing stuttering treatment services.

2. Method

2.1. Children

The inclusion criteria required that children were (a)
aged 3–6 years, (b) had been stuttering for a period
of at least 6-months by the time the treatment pro-
cedures began, (c) had Kuwaiti nationality, and (d)

spoke Arabic. The exclusion criteria were: (a) stuttering
at less than 2.0% syllables stuttered (%SS) during pre-
treatment data collection, (b) any treatment for stutter-
ing in the previous 6-months and (c) co-existing

Kuwaiti preschool children who presented to the
Sheikh Salem Al-Ali clinic with early stuttering were
recruited into the study. A total of 17 participants
who met the inclusion criteria were contacted and
recruited for
five were lost
the study, however
because families refused to wait for treatment for 2-
months during the pretreatment period, two families
planned to travel during the treatment period and
were not included in the study, and four parents dis-
continued contact during the pretreatment period.

All six children who took part in the study were
Kuwaiti, aged 4;9–5;11 years (median 5;3 years). Stutter-
ing severity at the time of assessment ranged from 3%
SS to 6.6%SS (median 5.75%) (See Appendix 1, table 1
for a summary of the children’s characteristics).

Participant G.O. This girl spoke both Arabic fluently
and some English. Her mother noted that she had
begun to stutter approximately 2 years previously
and that her younger sister has recently begun to
show signs of stuttering. During the initial assessment
it was noted that she had sound and syllable rep-
etitions, whole word repetitions, phrase repetitions,
very few prolongations and interestingly showed no
obvious signs of stuttering when she spoke in English
only in Arabic.

Participant R.J. This girl had a family history of stut-
tering and her parents reported that the onset of her
stuttering had occurred 3 years previously. Both
parents reported the onset of her stuttering to be fol-
lowing diagnosis and hospitalization with renal pro-
blems. During her initial assessment,
it was noted
that she had prolongations and part word repetitions.
Participant R.A. This boy’s mother noted that he
had begun to stutter 2 years previously. She communi-
cated to the first author that she was concerned about
R.A’s cousins bullying and commenting about his stut-
tering, which made him angry at times and upset,
making his stuttering worse. During his assessment, it
was noted that he had syllable and whole word
repetitions.

Participant H.A. The onset of stuttering for this boy
was noted approximately 3 years previously by his
parents. H.A had mainly part word or
syllable
repetitions.

Participant K.S. This boy’s parents reported signs of
stuttering for approximately one year prior to his initial
assessment. K.S’s mother also reported signs of second-
ary behaviors shortly before the commencement of
treatment. This included foot stomping during a

stutter. K.S’s mother reported that his father frequently
gave negative feedback about his stuttering, which
made K.S upset and angry. K.S’s stuttering consisted
of prolongations of sounds, syllable and sound rep-
etitions as well as blocks.

Participant B.M. This girl’s parents noted signs of
stuttering approximately 2 years 4 months prior to
her initial assessment. During her initial assessment, it
was noted that she had prolongations and part word
repetitions.

2.2. Training in the Lidcombe Program

The first author, who is a Kuwaiti SLP and who qualified
as an SLP in Australia, administered the treatment. The
first author speaks fluent Arabic and delivered the
treatment to all participants in Arabic. The first author
attended a professional education workshop con-
ducted by the Lidcombe Program Trainers Consortium
(LPTC), which trains SLPs in the Lidcombe Program, and
has also had supervised experience in Australia treating
children who stutter using the Lidcombe Program in
English.

2.3. The treatment

After consent was obtained, parents were contacted to
attend the clinic to give a case history, provide demo-
graphics data, and receive instructions on how and
when to make pretreatment
recordings. Children
then entered a 2-month pretreatment period during
which baseline data were collected.

translations were
made by each SLP and compared for verification. The
translated version of the LP manual was then used
for reference by the first author during the adminis-
tration of the LP. Each parent and child attended the
clinic for a 60-minute session, once a week. Severity

parents in everyday settings and situations while

To ensure correct and appropriate verbal feedback
was maintained using verbal contingencies (VC’s) at
home by the parents, the first author made obser-
vations of the parents’ attempts at implementing the
VC’s during structured conversations at home. This
was done by using recordings made at home by the
parent, which were then presented to the first author
during the sessions for discussion and feedback on
the appropriateness and adequacy of feedback pre-
sented by the parent(s) to their child.

228

M. AL-KHALEDI ET AL.

Four of the six children that took part in the study
completed Stage 1. Children moved onto Stage 2
after three consecutive clinic visits with measurements
of, (a) SRs of 1 or 2 for each day of the week, with at
least 4 days being at SR 1, and (b) %SS measured at
weekly clinic visits below 1.0%. During Stage 2 of the
program, parents returned to more frequent clinic
visits with their child,
in consultation with the first
author, if the child’s stuttering returned or increased.
This Stage 2 period of follow-ups and maintenance
lasted a total of four months, at intervals of 2-weeks,
1-month, 2-months and 4-months.

There are differences to note between Stages 1 and
2 of the treatment program. During Stage 1 of the
treatment, parents used the different types of verbal
contingencies frequently and on a daily basis, in struc-
tured and unstructured activities, while rating their
child’s speech. Parents were also required to attend
weekly (45–60 min) clinic sessions with their child. In
Stage 2, parents used verbal contingencies with their
child, however less frequently, mainly during unstruc-
tured treatment conversations/activities, while rating
their child’s speech. They also attended shorter clinic
sessions (30 min) that were scheduled systematically
in increasing intervals as long as the criteria was met.

2.4. Outcome measures

The outcome measures in this study were (a) stuttering
severity (%SS), (b) treatment time (time to complete
Stage 1), and (c) responses to parent survey.

2.4.1. Speech assessments and treatment times
Speech recordings were taken at 2-months, 1-month
and 1-week pretreatment and 2-weeks, 1-month, 2-
months and 4- months post-Stage 1 (these measures
commenced after completing Stage 1 and during the
commencement of Stage 2, maintenance stage).
Parents made recordings at home using audio-recorders
provided by the first author. On each occasion parents
collected two 10-minute samples of their child speaking
in two different situations beyond the clinic, (a) speaking
with a parent and (b) speaking with someone other than
their parent (e.g., a relative). Therefore, each parent gath-
ered six pretreatment speech samples and eight Stage 2
speech samples for their child. The primary dependent
measure was percent syllables stuttered (%SS) data
pre- and post-treatment (see table 2, appendix 1). This
data was averaged across.

Treatment time was the number of clinic visits and
the number of days taken by each participant to com-
plete Stage 1 and reach Stage 2 (table 3, appendix 1
below). These measures were made to assess treat-
ment efficiency.

2.4.2. Parent surveys
Surveys were given to parents after completing Stage
1. These surveys were adapted from Lewis et al.

(2008). The survey was designed to elicit parents’
opinions about the efficacy and adequacy of treatment
during Stage 1, and to inform any adjustments to the
program that may be required after the study was com-
pleted. The survey also asked parents about their level
of satisfaction with the treatment program, including
the use of different components of the program such
as using the severity rating scale. Other questions
included making quality recordings, which part of the
research design and the parent’s level of satisfaction
regarding communicating with the first author and
developing a good relationship, how often parents cor-
rected their children for stuttering and praised them for
not stuttering, as well as whether the experience was
positive for their child.

2.5. Reliability

Recordings were rated by the first author and were also
presented in random order to an independent rater, a
5th year student SLP at Kuwait University who was
independent of the study. The independent rater was
trained in identifying the types of stutters and counting
the moments of stuttering. Both the first author and
rater were fluent Arabic speakers. All
recordings
included in the data analysis contained approximately
300 syllables or were of 10 min duration. The first
author listened to the speech samples soon after they
were made. Samples that were inaudible were not
rated and parents were asked to re-do the recording.
The first author and student SLP stopped rating if a
child either
recited material or sang during the
recording.

For the purpose of establishing inter-rater reliability,
a random sample of 19 recordings (30% of the total
pretreatment, before Stage 1 and Stage 2 speech
samples) was presented in random order to the inde-
pendent rater. The mean difference between scores
was 0.14%SS and the greatest difference was 0.8%SS.
A Pearson product-moment correlation was carried
out to determine the strength of the relationship
between the two sets of %SS measures. The correlation
was high at r = 0.97, n = 19, p < .0005. Hence the data
were considered reliable.

3. Results

3.1. Speech outcomes

Of the six children that took part in the study, four com-
pleted the entire treatment program (Stages 1 and 2).
Both participants B.M and K.S. withdrew during Stage
1 as their mothers gave birth and their fathers were
unable to participate. B.M attended seven sessions,
while K.S attended eight sessions. There was nothing
unusual about the characteristics of these two children
(see Appendix 1, table 1, above).

All four children who completed Stage 1 reached
the program criteria for completion (i.e., %SS less
than or equal to 1.0 and daily SRs of 1 or 2 with the
majority being 1), for three consecutive clinic visits.
Overall there was a reduction in stuttering frequency
from the pretreatment period to the time of commen-
cing Stage 2 for all four participants. This was an
average reduction in stuttering frequency of 89%
(table 4, appendix 1).

Raw %SS data for each child are presented in the

Appendix 2 (See Appendix 2, tables A1- A4).

3.2. Clinical progress

The number of clinic hours taken by the four children
to complete Stage 1 is presented in table 3, appendix
1. A median of 10.5 clinic visits (1-hour each) was
required, which is consistent with the time taken in
early studies (Jones et al., 2000; Kingston et al., 2003;
Onslow et al., 1994) that were conducted prior to the
introduction of the requirement that the low stuttering
criteria were to be met for three consecutive clinic visits
before moving to Stage 2. The time taken was shorter
than reports in later studies (Rousseau, Packman,
Onslow, Harrison, & Jones, 2007). Table 3, appendix 1
(see above) shows that while the median number of
clinic visits was similar to previous studies the total
number of days to complete Stage 1 was longer. This
finding reflects the SLPs difficulties in getting parents
in Kuwait to attend weekly treatment sessions. For
example G.O was placed in Stage 2 after 7 visits but
114 days (16 weeks).

3.3. Percent syllables stuttered ratings

A total of 68 pretreatment (six participants) and Stage 2
(four participants) speech samples were collected.
These were taken during two speaking situations (at
home and away from home)
in Arabic only. The
mean pretreatment %SS for the four participants who
completed the program was 3.5 (SD = 1.23). The
mean follow-up %SS for these four participants was
0.37 (SD = 0.34).

Figure 1 presents the mean pretreatment %SS for
the four children who completed the
each of
program at each data collection time point. There is
no suggestion in these data that the children were
recovering naturally prior to treatment.

All four participants who completed the treatment
program (Stages 1 and 2) had no stuttering or very
low stuttering frequency (< 1.0%SS), with no relapse
recorded through the 4-month maintenance phase.
Figure 2 shows marked decreases in stuttering fre-
quency immediately after Stage 1 of the treatment
stage and a gradual decrease with a plateau in stutter-
ing frequency at near zero levels by 2 to 4-months
during Stage 2.

All four parents unanimously reported (a) that they are
satisfied with their child’s speech during the past
month (b) that they established good rapport with the
first author during Stage 1 of the treatment, allowing
easy communication and troubleshooting during the
treatment process (c) that they had enough training to
know how to make quality recordings, (d) that they
had enough training to feel confident in using the sever-
ity rating scale, (e) that there was enough time for them
to discuss their child’s treatment with the first author, (f)
and felt confident in asking the first author questions
and discussing their child’s speech measures.

Overall, results indicated that parents believed that
the treatment process was a positive experience for
them and their children. Some of the parent’s com-
ments include:

Indeed, the treatment sessions have had a positive
impact on my child’s condition.

This treatment is one of the most successful experi-
ences I have come across. I have had previous experi-
ence with other treatments for my older child, but
they were all ineffective.

4. Discussion

an efficacious

The current study is one of very few studies on the Lid-
combe Program conducted in Arabic and in a Middle
Eastern country. The study provides evidence that the
Lidcombe Program is
treatment
program for stuttering in Arab preschool aged children.
Children in the current study achieved outcomes
comparable to those attained by children in previous
studies, in terms of stuttering frequency and number
of sessions required to complete Stage 1 of the treat-
ment (Jones et al., 2000, 2005; Kingston et al., 2003;
Rousseau et al., 2007). Furthermore, participants in
the Jones et al. (2005) study had a mean pretreatment
%SS of 4.2, while the participants in the current study
had a mean pretreatment %SS of 3.5.

It is important to note however, that while the
number of clinic visits to complete Stage 1 was
within the benchmarks in the literature, the time
frame to complete these visits extended over a
longer period of time for all the children. A mean
total of 137 days was required to complete Stage 1 of
the treatment. This was due to many parents being
unable to attend sessions on a weekly basis consist-
ently. Similar to Hayhow’s (2009) study, many parents
found weekly clinic visits somewhat of a burden over
a long period of time, making consistent attendance
difficult. Cultural factors were evident in the current
study, such as the inability for women from traditional
Bedouin families to drive to sessions on their own and
relying on their husbands and other family members
reasons for missing sessions
for
included religious holidays (e.g., Eid Al Adha), as well
as traveling outside the country.

transport. Other

Some adaptations were made to the treatment
to
program in the current study in an attempt
promote its effectiveness with Kuwaiti parents and chil-
dren. Some parents were hesitant in using praise and
correction; as a result they delivered the verbal contin-
gencies (VCs) less frequently than expected. It was also
evident that for most of the parents it was difficult to
provide the required amount of praise. Some parents
reported that the daily correction of stuttered-speech
and praise of fluent speech as required by the Lid-
combe Program was unnatural and exaggerated. The
initial stage of the treatment requires parents to use
verbal contingencies following praise to correction
ratio of 5:1 during structured and unstructured conver-
sations. This requires that parents praise their child a lot
more than correcting their speech. Kuwaiti parents
found this ‘unnatural’ to them because it appears
from anecdotal parental reports that they have the

tendency to correct speech more, which comes natu-
rally to them. As a result comparatively more time
was spent training some of the parents in the current
study to implement the verbal contingencies correctly
and appropriately in every session. One parent in the
current study found the treatment approach a little dif-
ficult and challenging when using the VC’s with her
child (H.A), who was not progressing fast enough and
whose stuttering was fluctuating.

To ensure correct and appropriate feedback was
maintained at home by the parents, the first author
asked parents to make speech recordings of their
child at home in everyday settings. The aim of this exer-
cise was to observe parents attempting to implement
the VC’s during structured conversations at home.
Recordings were then presented to the first author
during the sessions for discussion and feedback.
If
parents continued to feel uncomfortable giving
verbal contingencies, they were trained by the first
author to use alternative forms of verbal and non-
verbal methods at home. This included ways of correct-
ing speech indirectly such as having the child repeat a
stuttered word by completing a sentence, and varying
the vocabulary when praising stutter-free speech that
correctly praises the child’s speech and not their
actions etc. For example ‘your talking was good’,
‘your words are smooth’. These methods proved to
be effective. While these adaptations are not outside
of those recommended in publications about the Lid-
combe Program (Onslow et al., 2003) the first author
felt that comparatively parents in Kuwait required
more training in delivering the verbal contingencies
than parents in Australia. In a recent study by Swift
et al. (2016), the correlation between contingencies
provided by parents with their child during the Lid-
combe Program and treatment duration were docu-
mented. The study found that parents had mostly
provided contingencies for the stutter-free speech
(91% of VCs), although all types of contingencies
were provided. Unexpectedly, there was a positive cor-
relation between providing the verbal contingencies
specifically for stuttering on treatment duration.

While there were two drop-outs in the current study,
the reasons were due to family circumstances and both
cases withdrew during stage 1 of the program. The
mothers of both children gave birth during this time,
and for cultural reasons the fathers were unable to con-
tinue with the treatment program. In the Arabic culture,
when mothers give birth they are expected to stay
home with their families for an extended period of
time (40 days). Newborns are usually not taken out at
all or infrequently during this time because mothers
are encouraged to keep them at home for health
reasons. This does not apply to all Arab families and
women, but to a large majority. The fathers did not par-
ticipate because they believed that mothers spend
more time with the child and are able to implement

the treatment program consistently. As a result both
fathers were reluctant to continue therapy.

again if they found that one of their other children
showed signs of stuttering.

SPEECH, LANGUAGE AND HEARING

231

Taken together the reason for the two dropouts and
the greater number of days in treatment for the Kuwaiti
children suggest that some adaptations to the service
delivery of the Lidcombe Program in Kuwait may be
needed. Home visits or a combination of face to face
delivery and telehealth delivery could be explored in
future research. This is likely to be a successful
the Lidcombe Program has
approach given that
already been established as being efficacious when
delivered solely via telehealth (Bridgman, Onslow,
O’Brian, Jones, & Block, 2016; Harrison, Wilson, &
Onslow, 1999; Lewis et al., 2008; Wilson, Onslow, &
Lincoln, 2004). Similarly, the Lidcombe Program may
be more realistically delivered in fortnightly clinic
visits in Kuwait. The efficacy of using dispersed clinic
visits has yet to be established. It may also be advisable
to delay the start of treatment with the Lidcombe
Program if family circumstances such as having a preg-
nant mother and/or having a father that is unwilling or
unable to participate in therapy sessions with the child,
which may ultimately hinder compliance and attend-
ing sessions regularly.

The outcomes of the current study suggest that the
Lidcombe Program may be as effective with Arabic
speaking families in Kuwait as it is in Western cultures.
For example, in the Jones et al. (2005) clinical trial, chil-
dren achieved a decrease in stuttering of 77%, while in
the current study there was an 89% decrease. Further-
more, a major finding of the current study was that all
four participants who completed the program, were
stuttering at very low frequencies (< 1.0%SS), or not
stuttering at all, 4-months post-Stage 1 (during Stage
2). No relapses were recorded in Stage 2.

Finally, the parent survey demonstrated that similar
to Western parents (e.g., Goodhue, Onslow, Quine,
O’Brian, & Hearne, 2010; Hayhow, 2009; Packman,
Hansen, & Herland, 2007) attending therapy sessions
was a positive experience for both parents and chil-
dren. The majority of responses to the 13 questions
that made up the survey indicated that all parents
felt attending therapy sessions was a positive experi-
ence for their child. Similar to a recent study by
Goodhue et al. (2010), parents felt confident in mana-
ging their child’s stuttering and in using the verbal con-
tingencies and responding to the moments of
stuttering. Parents in the current study also felt that
they had developed a positive relationship with the
first author who conducted the treatment program.
All parents that completed Stage 1 reported being sat-
isfied with their child’s speech over
the previous
month. No negative comments were made about the
program. Overall, parents displayed enthusiasm in the
program, similar to parents in other Western studies
(e.g., Hayhow, 2009) and some expressed interest in
sessions
attending Lidcombe Program treatment

5. Conclusion

The outcomes of the current study indicate that the
Lidcombe Program, which is a Western treatment
program, has an immediate impact on the natural pro-
gression of pre-school stuttering when delivered in
Arabic in Kuwait. The number of treatment sessions
required to complete the treatment program in the
study were comparable to those obtained in previous
studies. However it is perhaps due to cultural factors
that the time needed to complete therapy is much
longer than what was previously reported in other
studies. The Lidcombe Program is an efficacious treat-
ment program for preschool children when adminis-
tered in several languages, now including in Arabic to
Arabic speaking children, as seen in the current
study. While further trials are needed, the results indi-
cate that SLPs can be confident that implementing
the Lidcombe Program in Arabic is likely to achieve
positive results with stuttering in preschool children.
It is certainly a viable option for Kuwaiti preschoolers
who stutter. While the results are of a very small
group of children who stutter, they may be considered
as a preliminary guide that this treatment program can
be used in Kuwait and possibly in other Arabic-speak-
ing countries around the Middle East, as a possible
treatment of choice for early stuttering.

6. Limitations

Interpretation of outcomes in the current study is to be
done with caution. There are a some limitations to the
current study, which include the small sample size, half
of which were female preschoolers, whom studies
show recover more often than males. Furthermore,
the study only included Kuwaiti preschool children, as
a result children who stutter from other Arab and
non-Arab Middle Eastern countries are under-rep-
resented and results cannot be generalized to the
population of CWS in the Middle East. This is due to
the cultural differences that exist between countries.
Addressing these limitations would ultimately help
produce more reliable and generalizable results.
Having said that however, we should also emphasize
the importance this study may have as a preliminary
step to determine the effectiveness of the treatment
program among preschoolers in Kuwait.
