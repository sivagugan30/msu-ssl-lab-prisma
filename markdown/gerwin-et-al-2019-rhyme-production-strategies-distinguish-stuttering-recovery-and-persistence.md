Stuttering Recovery and Persistence

Purpose: The primary aim of the current study was to examine
the developing phonological awareness of 4- to 5-year-old
children who stutter (CWS) in relation to eventual recovery
(CWS-eRec) or persistance (CWS-ePer) in stuttering,
accounting for the presence of typical speech (TS) production
or speech sound disorder (SSD).
Method: In the 1st year of a 5-year longitudinal study,
37 children who do not stutter (CWNS) and 48 CWS
completed a rhyme discrimination and a rhyme production
task from the Phonological Awareness Test–Second Edition
(Robertson & Salter, 2007). Using data from their last year
of participation, CWS were classified into CWS-ePer and
CWS-eRec. Each CWS group was further divided into TS
and SSD groups based on speech production abilities at the
time of the rhyme tasks. Accuracy on the rhyme tasks was
compared. Groups were also compared on strategies used
to generate correct and incorrect responses for the rhyme

production task (e.g., real-word correct, nonword correct,
semantic association, repeated cues).
Results: All groups performed similarly on the rhyme
discrimination task. On the rhyme production task,
CWS-ePer-SSD and CWS-eRec-SSD performed with
less accuracy than CWNS, but CWS-ePer-TS, CWS-
eRec-TS, and CWNS achieved similar task accuracy.
On correct rhyme production trials, CWS-ePer-TS
created more nonword rhymes than real-word rhymes.
CWS-ePer-TS used the nonword strategy at 1.88 times
the CWNS rate. CWS-eRec-TS fell between CWS-ePer-TS
and CWNS in use of the nonword strategy.
Conclusions: Reliance on a nonword strategy for
rhyme production in CWS-ePer-TS may reflect
differences in underlying phonological representations
and ease of phonological access to the lexicon compared
to CWNS.

S tuttering is a speech disorder that typically onsets

between 2 and 4 years of age (Yairi & Ambrose,
1999). Five percent to 8% of preschool children

stutter, and of that group, 80% recover (Yairi & Ambrose,
1999, 2013). Stuttering is characterized by stuttering-like
disfluencies (SLDs) in the speech stream, including blocks,
part-word repetitions, single-syllable word repetitions, and
prolongations of sounds (Ambrose & Yairi, 1999). Al-
though these observable disfluencies characterize the disor-
der, many theories of stuttering argue that studying the
characteristics of SLDs is not sufficient for understanding
the development and course of the disorder (e.g., dual di-
athesis-stressor model, Walden et al., 2012; demands and

2017).

In the MDP theory, Smith and Weber (2017) pro-

pose that individual contributing factors be investigated
in the context of dynamic neurodevelopmental interactions.
Factors are investigated in the onset and trajectory of
stuttering persistence or recovery. Within this framework,
stuttering is thought to result from unstable speech motor
networks, which interact with rapidly developing linguistic
and psychosocial systems. The authors suggest that these
interacting neural systems may develop to further support
or interfere with speech motor stabilization, resulting in
either recovery or persistence in children who stutter (CWS;
Smith & Weber, 2017). The current study focuses on fur-
thering our understanding of the influence of developing
phonology as a factor that may help to predict whether a
young child will recover or persist in stuttering. Specifically,
we assess emerging phonological awareness skills through
rhyme discrimination and rhyme production tasks in 4- to
5-year-old children who are stuttering and grouped according

Development of Phonological Knowledge
and Phonological Awareness

Phonological knowledge has been conceptualized as
interacting levels of representation, including acoustic–
phonetic, phonological, and articulatory–phonetic repre-
sentations (Rvachew & Brosseau-Lapré, 2018; Savage,
Blair, & Rvachew, 2006). Phonological representations
include the encoded phonological characteristics of words
such as individual phonemes and the rules by which
those phonemes are combined (Preston & Edwards, 2010;
Rvachew & Brosseau-Lapré, 2018). Acoustic–phonetic
representations are built as the child perceives speech in-
put, whereas articulatory–phonetic representations emerge
from a child’s experience with speech production (Edwards,
Beckman, & Munson, 2004; Rvachew & Brosseau-Lapré,
2012; Savage et al., 2006).

As a child’s mental lexicon expands to include an
increasing number of words, the phonological representa-
tions restructure, identifying frequent sublexical units such
as syllables, rimes, onsets, and phonemes (Metsala, 1997;
Rvachew, 2006; Rvachew & Grawburg, 2006). The restruc-
turing is thought to allow the child to become aware of
smaller sublexical units to efficiently contrast words that
sound similar, such as minimal pairs (Metsala, 1997). This
restructuring based on speech perception and increasing
receptive language is a proposed mechanism for the devel-
opment of phonological awareness (Rvachew & Grawburg,
2006). In other words, the development of phonological
awareness skills or the knowledge that words are composed
of sublexical units relies on detailed and well-specified un-
derlying representations (Elbro & Pallesen, 2002).

Edwards et al. (2004) provided evidence that increases
in lexicon size contribute to the development of more de-
tailed underlying representations of words that contain
phoneme-level information. They assessed the abilities of
104 children with typical development ages 3–8 years to re-
peat nonwords with phoneme sequences, which were either
infrequent (absent and rare) or frequent in a database of
child language. The children repeated the nonwords with
frequent phoneme sequences more accurately than nonwords
with infrequent phoneme sequences. Additional analyses
showed that the children’s vocabulary size, rather than age,
predicted their accuracy in repeating nonwords, especially
those containing infrequent phoneme sequences. The au-
thors concluded that children with larger vocabulary sizes
were able to extract more robust representations at the pho-
neme level from the growing number of words in their lexi-
con. In turn, this allowed them to more accurately combine
and repeat these infrequent sequences of phonemes.

As restructuring occurs, phonological awareness of

sublexical units tends to follow a developmental order from
larger units, such as words and syllables, to smaller units,
such as phonemes (Anthony & Francis, 2005; Anthony et al.,
2002; Anthony, Lonigan, Driscoll, Phillips, & Burgess,

2003). Cross-cultural studies reveal that the features of a
child’s native language influence the order of awareness
for sublexical units of similar size. For example, English-
speaking children may develop onset–rime awareness (e.g.,
c-at) before head–coda awareness (e.g., ca-t), whereas
Japanese children show the opposite pattern. This occurs
because English has a high proportion of words with simi-
lar rimes (Anthony & Francis, 2005).

A similar developmental order exists for the type of

phonological awareness task used to assess a given sublexi-
cal unit. In a study of children ages 2–6 years, Anthony
et al. (2003) demonstrated that children tend to be able to
complete phonological awareness detection tasks (e.g., hear
separated syllables, choose the picture that represents the
word that blends the syllables) before they complete pro-
duction tasks (e.g., hear separated syllables, produce the
word that blends the syllables). In addition, children were
able to blend phonological units before they could elide
units. The authors conclude that assessment of phonologi-
cal awareness should take into consideration both task and
sublexical unit.

The current study focuses on onset–rime awareness
or rhyming abilities. These abilities develop rapidly during
the same time period as most stuttering onsets. Children
begin demonstrating rhyming abilities as early as 2–3 years
of age (Lonigan, Burgess, Anthony, & Barker, 1998; Maclean,
Bryant, & Bradley, 1987). Maclean et al. (1987) showed that,
at age 3 years, 21% of their 66 subjects demonstrated rhyme
detection above chance level and 42% could produce at
least one rhyming word out of five opportunities. Carroll,
Snowling, Stevenson, and Hulme (2003) found that perfor-
mance on rhyme detection was still variable, but increasing,
among children as they aged from 4 to 5 years. Over that
year time frame, the percentage of children scoring above
chance rose from 23.88% to 65.67%. Figure 1 summarizes
children’s accuracy on rhyme detection tasks across differ-
ent age groups as reported in various investigations of
phonological development (Carroll et al., 2003; Corriveau,
Goswami, & Thomson, 2010; Lonigan et al., 1998; Maclean
et al., 1987). Studies included rhyme-matching tasks, in
which participants choose a word from two options that
rhymes with a stimulus (Carroll et al., 2003; Maclean et al.,
1987), and rhyme oddity tasks, in which participants choose
a word from three to four options that does not rhyme
with the others (Corriveau et al., 2010; Lonigan et al., 1998;
Maclean et al., 1987). An overall regression line taking into
account data points from each study is included in the figure
to approximate rhyme detection development over time.

Rhyme production development has not been studied

as thoroughly as rhyme detection. For example, Maclean
et al. (1987) assessed rhyme production in only one session
of their 15-month longitudinal study, whereas rhyme detec-
tion was studied at all four sessions. However, when rhyme
production and rhyme detection tasks are both assessed in
a study, they tend to follow a pattern consistent with the
findings of Anthony et al. (2003) where accuracy on detec-
tion tasks is higher than on production tasks (Gernand &
Moran, 2007; Savage et al., 2006). Savage et al. (2006) noted

rhyme tasks across ages (Carroll et al., 2003; Corriveau et al., 2010; Lonigan et al., 1998; Maclean et al., 1987). Studies
included rhyme-matching tasks, in which participants choose a word from two options that rhymes with a stimulus (Carroll
et al., 2003; Maclean et al., 1987), and rhyme oddity tasks, in which participants choose a word from three to four options that

that children ages 3–6 years completed a receptive rhyming
discrimination task more accurately than a common unit
rhyme production task. In the discrimination task, each
child was asked to indicate whether two presented words
rhymed or not, whereas for the common unit task, each
child was asked to produce the common unit or rime of the
two presented words. The current study investigated rhym-
ing skills using both a rhyme discrimination and rhyme
production task.

Furthermore, the current study extends investigation
of rhyme production from a measurement of task accuracy
only to include an analysis of the strategies used to complete
the task. Rhyme production tasks do not always limit correct
responses to real words. Two studies that included rhyme
production tasks accepted real-word and nonword rhymes
as correct (Maclean et al., 1987; Schaefer, Stackhouse, &
Wells, 2017). However, participants’ use of real-word and
nonword strategies was not reported. One study that in-
cluded four typically developing children (ages 5–7 years)
reported the proportion of real-word and nonword rhyming
responses provided during rhyme production (Marion,
Sussman, & Marquardt, 1993). In this study, all of the
typically developing children provided more real-word
rhymes than nonword rhymes. Incorrect responses were
also divided into nonrhymes, no response, and unintelligi-
ble. However, none of these three studies investigating
rhyme production reported the types of nonrhyming re-
sponses, such as whether or not they were real words. In-
vestigating the types of rhyme and nonrhyme production

responses may provide a deeper understanding of the pro-
cesses underlying task accuracy for children with high and
low scores. For instance, if a child cannot rhyme but re-
sponds to each trial, questions may be asked about what
type of response they provided and how they may have
arrived at that particular response. Therefore, we extended
investigation of rhyme production to include the type of
rhyme production strategy used for both correct and in-
correct responses.

Stuttering and Phonological Production

During the time period when stuttering onsets are

most likely to occur, a child’s speech sound production ac-
curacy is increasing dramatically. Figure 2 shows the percent
whole words correct a child produces in spontaneous speech,
increasing from approximately 30% at age 25 months
to approximately 88% at 60 months of age (Rvachew &
Brosseau-Lapré, 2018, pp. 164–169; for reviews, see Bunta,
Fabiano-Smith, Goldstein, & Ingram, 2009; Ingram, 2002;
MacLeod, Laukys, & Rvachew, 2011; Schmitt, Howard, &
Schmitt, 1983). This rapid development of accurate speech
sound production occurs naturally in most children; how-
ever, speech sound disorder (SSD) occurs when a child mis-
pronounces more speech sounds than is typical for their age
(American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 1993).
SSD represents the highest proportion of cases seen by
speech-language pathologists practicing in pediatric settings
(Broomfield & Dodd, 2004; Mullen & Schooling, 2010).

from Rvachew & Brosseau-Lapré, 2018, pp. 164–169; for reviews, see Bunta et al., 2009; Ingram, 2002; MacLeod
et al., 2011; Schmitt et al., 1983). The gray rectangle represents the onset of stuttering, which usually occurs between
24 and 48 months of age (Yairi & Ambrose, 2013). Phonological production accuracy increases steeply from approximately
30% at 25 months of age to approximately 80% at 48 months of age.

Researchers estimate that 30%–40% of CWS also have a
concomitant SSD, and boys who stutter are more likely
than girls who stutter to have co-occurring SSD (Blood,
Ridenour, Qualls, & Hammer, 2003; Wolk, Conture, &
Edwards, 1990). Wolk, Edwards, and Conture (1993) found
that a sample of male CWS with SSD produced a greater
percentage of sound prolongations and fewer word repeti-
tion iterations compared to the CWS without SSD. How-
ever, other studies, some with more stringent inclusionary
criteria and including female CWS, did not support a rela-
tionship between types of disfluencies and SSDs (Gregg &
Yairi, 2007, 2012; Yaruss & Conture, 1996).

In a longitudinal study, Paden, Yairi, and Ambrose

(1999) investigated the acquisition of phonological skills as
it related to persistence or recovery from stuttering. Stut-
tering status was determined for a cohort of 84 children
after following them for at least 2 years post–stuttering on-
set. Phonology was assessed using data from the first year
of participation when the children were between the ages
of 2;1 and 4;11 (years;months). Paden et al. concluded
that, as a group, children who persisted in stuttering
had lower scores on the Assessment of Phonological
Processes–Revised (Hodson, 1986) when scores are weighted
by age in months, compared to those who would recover.
Interestingly, both groups acquired phonological skills in
the expected developmental order; however, the children
who would persist consistently made more errors in phono-
logical patterns developing in the preschool years than the
children who would recover. Similarly, Spencer and Weber-
Fox (2014) found that a standardized measure of articulation

and performance on a nonword repetition task (Dollaghan
& Campbell, 1998) was a predictor of recovery and persis-
tence in preschool CWS. Both Paden et al. and Spencer and
Weber-Fox emphasize that their findings are group effects
with a wide range of individual differences present. Taken
together, these studies suggest that phonological production
development may be related to stuttering outcomes in some
young children.

Stuttering and Phonological Awareness

In addition to phonological production, phonological

awareness has been investigated in CWS. Pelczarski and
Yaruss (2014) examined phonological awareness in 10 CWS
and 10 children who do not stutter (CWNS) ages 5–6 years
using the Phonological Awareness Composite Score of
the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing
(Wagner, Torgesen, & Rashotte, 1999). The three phono-
logical awareness subtests were administered: Sound
Matching, Elision, and Blending Words. The Sound
Matching subtest is the only one in which the child was
presented with a stimulus and provided response options.
Pictures were provided on each trial, and the child was
asked to point to the picture that starts with the same
sound as the target. The Blending Words and Elision sub-
tests required the child to produce a response based on the
stimulus provided. For instance, on the Blending Words
subtest, the child was asked, “which word do these sounds
make” when given constituent parts such as syllables
or phonemes (e.g., “can-” /kæn/ and “-dy” /di/—“candy”

Downloaded from: https://pubs.asha.org Michigan State University on 11/11/2025, Terms of Use: https://pubs.asha.org/pubs/rights_and_permissions /kændi/). On the Elision subtest, the child was asked to
remove a sound from a target to create another real word
(e.g., say cup /kʌp/ without /k/—“up” /ʌp/). All children
scored within normal limits for their age on this assessment;
however, CWNS scored higher than CWS on the com-
posite score, Blending Words subtest, and Elision subtest,
but not the Sound Matching subtest. These findings suggest
subtle differences in phonological awareness abilities of
CWS, particularly when tasks require the production of
a response (Blending Words and Elision subtests) rather
than selection of an answer choice (Sound Matching subtest).
These findings may reflect less refinement of the underlying
phonological representations in CWS (Pelczarski & Yaruss,
2014).

Previous research into the neural underpinnings of

phonological processing using event-related potentials (ERPs)
and rhyme discrimination tasks reveal differences between
people who stutter and age-matched peers at a variety of
ages, including adults (Weber-Fox, Spencer, Spruill, &
Smith, 2004), children ages 9–13 years (Weber-Fox, Spencer,
Cuadrado, & Smith, 2003; Weber-Fox, Spruill, Spencer, &
Smith, 2008), and most recently children ages 7–8 years
(Mohan & Weber, 2015). This most recent study is signifi-
cant because the ERPs elicited by rhyming and nonrhyming
word pairs distinguished CWS who had recovered at the
time of testing from those who were continuing to stutter.
One limitation of these ERP studies in children and adults
who stutter is that they examine processes mediating rhyme
discrimination only, not rhyme production. The current
study furthers the investigation of phonological awareness,
namely, rhyming, in CWS by including rhyme discrimina-
tion and production tasks.

In addition, the current study accounts for how the
presence of SSD may impact the relationship between the
development of phonological awareness and persistence and
recovery in CWS. It has been estimated that up to 30%–40%
of CWS may also have an SSD (Wolk et al., 1990). Children
with SSD produce more articulation errors than other chil-
dren of the same age and are particularly at risk of present-
ing with deficits in phonological awareness (e.g., Raitano,
Pennington, Tunick, Boada, & Shriberg, 2004; Rvachew,
Ohberg, Grawburg, & Heyding, 2003). There is currently
no consensus on the causes of SSD (Munson & Krause,
2017). Nonetheless, Waring and Knight (2013) identified
three common subgroups of children in current classification
systems of children with SSD based on etiological differences
(speech disorders classification system; e.g., Shriberg et al.,
2010), psycholinguistic profiles of the children (psycholin-
guistic framework; Stackhouse & Wells, 1997), and linguis-
tic manifestations of the disorder (differential diagnosis
classification system; Dodd, 1995, 2005). The majority of
children were classified in the phonological subgroup; smaller
groups of children presented with residual speech errors
and were in the articulation-based subgroup or presented
with motor speech disorders and were in the motor planning/
programming subgroup.

As a group, children with SSD have more poorly

specified phonological representations than children of the

same age with typical speech development and have been
found to have more difficulties with phonological pro-
cessing tasks such as speech perception and phonological
awareness skills (Anthony et al., 2011; Rvachew, 2006).
It has been proposed that their imprecise underlying pho-
nological representations lead to the production of more
omission and substitution errors than children with typical
development, as well as difficulties with phonological pro-
cessing (e.g., Anthony et al., 2010; Rvachew, 2006; Rvachew,
Chiang, & Evans, 2007). In the current study, we consid-
ered that the presence of SSD may impact developing phono-
logical awareness and prediction of recovery and persistence
within the CWS population.

The Current Study

The primary aim of the current study was to examine

the developing phonological awareness of 4- to 5-year-old
CWS in relation to eventual recovery or persistence in
stuttering. We assessed phonological awareness using both
rhyme discrimination and rhyme production. Based on
earlier findings in older CWS (Mohan & Weber, 2015;
Pelczarski & Yaruss, 2014), we predicted that accuracy of
rhyme discrimination may not distinguish eventual per-
sistence or recovery from stuttering. However, given the
additional demands of retrieval and speech formulation
for rhyme production, we predicted that CWS who eventu-
ally persisted (CWS-ePer) would display lower accuracy
relative to CWNS and CWS who eventually recovered
(CWS-eRec). Although slightly lower than CWNS perfor-
mance, CWS who had recovered and CWS who had per-
sisted at ages 7–8 years demonstrated similar accuracy in
rhyme discrimination (Mohan & Weber, 2015). In con-
trast, earlier findings from phonological awareness tasks,
which included speech production, revealed reduced accu-
racy by CWS relative to CWNS (Pelczarski & Yaruss, 2014).
It is important to highlight that the current study investi-
gated children ages 4–5 years who were currently develop-
ing rhyming abilities, and therefore, we expected greater
variability in performance than in the 5- to 8-year-old chil-
dren in these previous studies. A CWNS group was in-
cluded in the current study to interpret differences between
CWS-ePer and CWS-eRec. Previous research indicates that
CWS-eRec may perform similarly to CWNS or fall be-
tween CWNS and CWS-ePer on measures used to predict
recovery and persistence (Walsh et al., 2018).

Furthermore, to comprehensively assess the primary

aim, we grouped CWS according to their speech sound
production abilities in addition to eventual recovery or per-
sistence in stuttering. We know that a significant portion
of CWS have a concomitant SSD and that children with
SSD have difficulty with phonological awareness skills. There-
fore, if rhyme discrimination or production distinguishes
eventual stuttering recovery or persistence in children with
typical speech production, it is unclear whether this vari-
able would also predict stuttering outcome in CWS with
SSD. To investigate this relationship, we compared the

both of our rhyme tasks.

Finally, the current study was designed to evaluate
an additional aspect of rhyme production, specifically the
use of rhyme production strategies. Rhyme production has
been less extensively researched compared to rhyme discrimi-
nation, and few studies reported on the types of correct or
incorrect responses generated by participants. The current
design allowed us to investigate the types of responses pro-
duced by a large sample of 4- to 5-year-old children with a
range of phonological awareness skills. This measure pro-
vided new depth to the rhyme production task by investi-
gating potential processes underlying task accuracy.

In summary, the current study expanded on previous

studies of rhyming in CWS and CWNS in several ways.
First, the current study included CWS with a wide range
of phonological awareness skills, such as those who exhibit
SSD, to be more representative of the CWS population.
Second, both rhyme discrimination and rhyme production
tasks were included. As mentioned previously, ERP studies
in CWS have focused on rhyme discrimination. However,
it is recommended that phonological awareness of a partic-
ular sublexical unit be assessed with tasks of varying difficulty
(Anthony et al., 2003). Finally, in addition to measuring
rhyme discrimination and rhyme production task accuracy,
we also examined the type of rhyme production strategies
used by each child.

Method
Participants

Participants were part of a 5-year longitudinal study
as part of the Purdue Stuttering Project conducted at Purdue
University and the University of Iowa. Eighty-five children
ranging from ages 3;5 to 5;10 at their first visit were in-
cluded in the current study. Of those children, 37 were
CWNS, 19 were CWS-ePer, and 29 were CWS-eRec.

All clinical assessments and diagnoses were completed
by a certified speech-language pathologist. The two Purdue
Stuttering Project speech-language pathologists at the Pur-
due University and University of Iowa sites have extensive
experience specializing in the diagnosis and treatment of
CWS. A participant was diagnosed as stuttering in their
first year of participation if they met the following criteria
based on Yairi and Ambrose (1999): (a) the child’s parent(s)
perceived the child as stuttering; (b) the project speech-
language pathologist perceived the child as stuttering and
rated stuttering severity as a 2 or higher on an 8-point scale
where 0–1 was considered typical fluency, 2–3 was consid-
ered mild stuttering, 4–5 was considered moderate stuttering,
and 6–7 was considered severe stuttering; and (c) the child
produced at least three SLDs per 100 syllables in a sponta-
neous speech sample. In a number of cases (23% of the
CWS), the child did not produce three SLDs per 100 syllables,
and parents reported that the language samples collected
in the laboratory during the parent–child and clinician–
child interactions were not representative of the child’s

disfluencies at home and in other contexts. This description
is consistent with reports that stuttering can vary across sit-
uations (Yaruss, 1997). In these cases, the project speech-
language pathologist assessed the child’s fluency through-
out additional interactions during the visits to the lab. This
included several contexts, for example, first meeting with
the child during lab tours and transitions between labs, and
during other speech and language assessments. The speech-
language pathologist’s diagnosis of stuttering in these cases
was then based on the observed frequency and character-
istics of SLDs, which exceeded that of typical fluency.
Characteristics of SLDs included factors such as number
of iterations, presence of respiratory irregularities, tension,
abnormal intonation patterns, and/or pauses.

Formation of Groups

Five groups were formed to account for stuttering
status and SSD. CWS were followed for 12–48 months
after their initial visit. Each year of participation, they were
evaluated for stuttering based on criteria from Yairi and
Ambrose (1999) mentioned previously. CWS were divided
into the CWS-ePer and CWS-eRec groups based on the
assessment of stuttering in their last year of participation.
Children were considered recovered from stuttering if they
met the following criteria: (a) the child’s parent(s) no longer
perceived the child as stuttering; (b) the project speech-
language pathologist no longer perceived the child as stut-
tering and stuttering severity was rated as a 1 or lower on
the 8-point scale where 0–1 was considered typical fluency,
2–3 was considered mild stuttering, 4–5 was considered
moderate stuttering, and 6–7 was considered severe stutter-
ing; and (c) the child produced less than three SLDs per
100 syllables in a spontaneous speech sample. A CWS
participant was considered to be persisting unless he or
she met all of the above recovery criteria. Of the 48 CWS,
29 eventually recovered from stuttering (CWS-eRec)
and 19 eventually persisted (CWS-ePer). Information
about length of participation, age at first and last year
of participation, therapy by the first year of participa-
tion, and family history of recovery and persistence
from stuttering can be found for each CWS participant in
Table 1.

Groups were further divided based on the presence

or absence of SSD in their first year of participation when
the rhyme tasks of interest (described below) were admin-
istered. Children assigned to the SSD groups scored be-
low a standard score of 85 on the Consonant Inventory
and/or the Phonological Processes Inventory of the Bankson–
Bernthal Test of Phonology (BBTOP; Bankson & Bernthal,
1990). All CWS and CWNS, including those assigned to
the SSD group, passed an oral–motor screening assessment
and therefore did not present with a motor–speech disor-
der (Robbins & Klee, 1987). CWS-eRec and CWS-ePer
groups were subdivided into those with SSD and typical
speech (TS). Consistent with estimates from the literature,
the overall percentage of CWS in our sample with a con-
comitant SSD was 44%. Of the CWS-eRec, 11 had SSD
(CWS-eRec-SSD) and 18 had TS (CWS-eRec-TS). Of

an = 10 because one participant did not complete all subtests to calculate the TACL-3 Quotient score.

2.15, p = .08. Nonverbal intelligence was measured using
the Columbia Mental Maturity Scale (Burgemeister, Blum,
& Lorge, 1972). Socioeconomic status (SES) was estimated
from the mother’s level of education using the Hollingshead
Education Scale (Hollingshead, 1975). This scale provides
a score starting at 1, which represents “less than seventh
grade,” through 7, which represents “graduate professional
training (graduate degree)” (Hollingshead, 1975). Match-
ing for SES was particularly important as differences in
rhyming abilities have been noted in 3- to 5-year-old chil-
dren when divided into groups based on SES (Lonigan et al.,
1998).

Finally, receptive language was assessed using the

Test for Auditory Comprehension of Language–Third Edition
(TACL-3; Carrow-Woolfolk, 1999). The TACL-3 is made
up of three subtests (Vocabulary, Grammatical Morphemes,
and Elaborated Phrases and Sentences), which combine to
provide an overall quotient measure. One participant in the
CWS-ePer-SSD group did not complete the Elaborated
Phrases and Sentences subtest and therefore does not have
a quotient score. Groups were matched on the TACL-3 over-
all quotient score, F(4, 79) = 1.47, p = .22, as well as the
scaled scores for the Vocabulary subtest, F(4, 80) = 0.29,
p = .88; the Grammatical Morphemes subtest, F(4, 80) =
1.54, p = .20; and the Elaborated Phrases and Sentences
subtest, F(4, 79) = 1.75, p = .15. Group means for age, SES,
Columbia Mental Maturity Scale standard score, and
TACL-3 quotient score are reported in Table 2.

Rhyme Tasks

Tasks for the current study were taken from the Pho-

nological Awareness Test–Second Edition, which is designed
to assess a variety of phonological awareness skills related
to literacy (Robertson & Salter, 2007). Specifically, we used
the Rhyming Subtest of the Phonological Awareness Test–
Second Edition, which assesses rhyme discrimination and
rhyme production abilities. Both tasks were administered
in accordance with the test manual. During the rhyme
discrimination task, the child listened to two words and

decided whether the words rhymed by answering “yes” or
“no.” During the rhyme production task, the child listened
to a stimulus word and provided a word that rhymes with
the stimulus. Both the discrimination and production tasks
included one practice item with feedback followed by 10 test
items. Correct trials out of 10 were recorded for each sub-
test. On the production task, children were instructed that
they could provide a real word or nonword that rhymed
with the stimulus word. For instance, if the stimulus word
was “cat” /kæt/, children received credit for producing a
real word such as “bat” /bæt/ or a nonword such as “blat”
/blæt/. Furthermore, the rhyme production task was
compared to the results of the BBTOP, and participants
were given credit for answers that would rhyme but con-
tained identified phonological processes or errors. For
instance, a child with documented stopping of fricatives
would receive credit for “mother” pronounced /mʌdɚ/ in re-
sponse to the stimulus brother /bɹʌðɚ/. BBTOPs were con-
sulted for five participants (one CWNS, two CWS-eRec-TS,
and two CWS-ePer-TS), and documented errors allowed
additional credit in three cases (one CWS-eRec-TS and
two CWS-ePer-TS).

The words produced by the children during the rhyme
production task were documented in writing for all partici-
pants except two CWNS where only a score was provided.
The responses given by the children were categorized based
on the strategy by which the child arrived at their response.
Children demonstrated a wide variety of correct and incor-
rect responses to the 10 rhyme production prompts. Correct
responses could be obtained by creating a real English word
(real-word correct strategy) or a nonword (nonword correct
strategy) that rhymed with the prompt. Incorrect responses
were more variable containing strategies such as attempts at
rhyming real words (e.g., “pan”–“hand”), attempts at rhym-
ing nonwords (e.g., “shower”–“crowber”), semantic associa-
tions (e.g., “bark”–“dog”), cue repetition (e.g., “kite”–“kite”),
and a variety of nonresponses (e.g., “I don’t know”). There
were also trials in which no clear strategy could be
identified (e.g., “brother”–“bubble,” “shower”–“kitten,”
“kite”–“rat”).

Downloaded from: https://pubs.asha.org Michigan State University on 11/11/2025, Terms of Use: https://pubs.asha.org/pubs/rights_and_permissions The current analyses focused on the following top

four identifiable strategies, which captured 73% of the
overall responses: real-word correct, nonword correct, seman-
tic association, and cue repetition strategies. The remaining
27% of responses were trials with no clear strategy (18%),
nonresponses (4%), and the remaining incorrect strategies
(5%).

Data Analysis
Task Accuracy

The rhyme discrimination and rhyme production

scores were not normally distributed and showed skewed or
bimodal distributions. These distributions suggested that,
at this age, participants who could rhyme performed with
high accuracy whereas those who were still developing
rhyming abilities performed with low accuracy. As a result,
there were few scores in the midrange. Given these distribu-
tions, nonparametric statistical assessments were utilized.
To determine whether the five groups differed in rhyme
production or rhyme discrimination accuracy, a separate
Kruskal–Wallis test was completed for each task. Significance
values were set at p < .05. When significant group differences
were detected, pairwise comparisons were completed to deter-
mine differences between specific groups. To determine the
relationship between task accuracy and stuttering outcome,
comparisons were made between groups that eventually
recovered and those that eventually persisted (CWS-ePer-TS
to CWS-eRec-TS, CWS-ePer-SSD to CWS-eRec-SSD). In
addition, to understand how task accuracy may differ be-
tween CWNS and CWS, each CWS group was compared
to the CWNS group (CWNS to CWS-ePer-TS, CWS-eRec-
TS, CWS-ePer-SSD, CWS-eRec-SSD). A total of six pairwise
comparisons were made for each task using Mann–Whitney
U tests. The Bonferroni corrected p value for the post hoc
comparisons was p = .008. IBM SPSS Statistics (Version 24)
was used for these analyses.

Rhyme Production Strategies

Interrater reliability of rhyme production strategy

categorization was performed on 17 participants (21% of
the sample). Agreement between a trained second rater
and the first author was 94%. Negative binomial regression
was used to evaluate the rhyme production strategies of each
group where the count of each of the four primary strategies
is the outcome in four separate regression models (Long,
1997). Models were also estimated separately for partici-
pants with and without SSD, resulting in eight separate
negative binomial regressions. The count outcomes were
not normally distributed and followed a Poisson distri-
bution. Tests showed that there was overdispersion for the
counts of each of the four strategies, and therefore, nega-
tive binomial regression was used as a correction (Long,
1997). Age, mother’s level of education, and nonverbal
intelligence were controlled for in all models. Effects were
interpreted as incidence rate ratios, which are obtained by
exponentiating the raw coefficients (expected log counts).
Incident rate ratios, which reflect effect size, give the rate

of use of a specific strategy for one group versus another
group over the trials. Therefore, the negative binomial re-
gression allowed us to test rhyme production strategies used
as a function of stuttering outcome (eventually recovered,
eventually persisted, typically fluent). Stata (Version 15)
was used for these analyses (StataCorp, 2017).

In addition, the proportion of responses made using

each strategy was calculated for each group to provide a
group-specific description of strategy use. Individual patterns
of strategy use on correct trials were also explored to ensure
that the group-specific description of strategy use was not
driven by a few high-performing participants. For example,
because correct trials must be either real words or nonwords,
a highly accurate participant who uses only one strategy (e.g.,
10 correct trials all achieved by the real-word correct strategy)
could influence the group patterns more readily than a less
accurate participant who uses both the real-word and non-
word correct strategies (e.g., two correct trials with one
achieved by each strategy). Individual patterns were in-
vestigated by calculating the number of individuals in each
group using the real-word and nonword strategy equally
(RW = NW), the real-word strategy more than the non-
word strategy (RW > NW), or the nonword strategy more
than the real-word strategy (NW > RW) on correct trials.
Reported percentages are rounded to the nearest whole
number.

Results

Average scores and standard deviations of the rhyme

discrimination and rhyme production task for each group
are presented in Table 3. One CWNS completed the
rhyme discrimination task but did not complete the rhyme
production task. Kruskal–Wallis tests revealed differences
between the groups on the rhyme discrimination task,
χ2(4) = 9.93, p = .04, and the rhyme production task, χ2(4) =
15.22, p < .01. Mann–Whitney U pairwise comparisons
with a Bonferroni-corrected p value ( p = .008) were used to

on each task. Results of the six comparisons made for each
task are displayed in Figure 3 and described below.

Rhyme Discrimination

CWS who eventually persisted performed similarly
to those who eventually recovered on the rhyme discrimi-
nation task, CWS-ePer-TS and CWS-eRec-TS (U = 58.50,
z = −1.19, p = .25) and CWS-ePer-SSD and CWS-eRec-SSD
(U = 48.50, z = −0.46, p = .65). In addition, all CWS groups

performed similarly to CWNS, CWNS and CWS-ePer-TS
(U = 145.50, z = −0.60, p = .57), CWNS and CWS-eRec-TS
(U = 290.00, z = −0.79, p = .43), CWNS and CWS-ePer-
SSD (U = 98.00, z = −2.31, p = .02), and CWNS and
CWS-eRec-SSD (U = 132.50, z = −1.78, p = .08).

conservative Bonferroni-corrected p value (p = .008) revealed that groups performed similarly on the rhyme discrimination task. On the
rhyme production task, groups with typical speech (TS) performed with similar accuracy; however, the groups of CWS (children who stutter)
with speech sound disorder (SSD) performed significantly lower than children who do not stutter (CWNS). CWS-eRec = children who stutter
and eventually recovered; CWS-ePer = children who stutter and eventually persisted.

−0.26, p = .82) and CWS-ePer-SSD and CWS-eRec-SSD
(U = 51.50, z = −0.27, p = .81). CWS groups with TS scored
similarly to CWNS on the rhyme production task, CWNS
and CWS-ePer-TS (U = 157.00, z = −0.14, p = .90) and
CWNS and CWS-eRec-TS (U = 296.50, z = −0.51, p =
.61). However, CWNS scored higher than the two CWS
groups with SSD on the rhyme production task, CWNS and
CWS-ePer-SSD (U = 71.00, z = −2.95, p < .008) and CWNS
and CWS-eRec-SSD (U = 86.00, z = −2.85, p < .008).

Strategies

We examined the incidence rate ratio to test differ-

ences across groups in the rate of rhyme production re-
sponses made using the following strategies: real-word
correct, nonword correct, semantic association, and re-
peated cues. Table 4 contains the results of all eight nega-
tive binomial regressions comparing groups on the use
of rhyme production strategies. Negative binomial re-
gression interpreted as incident rate ratios revealed that,
as a group, CWS-ePer-TS were more likely to use non-
word correct strategy compared to the CWNS. Their rate
of using this strategy was 1.88 times the rate for CWNS
( p = .02). The comparisons of strategy use between
CWS-eRec-TS and CWNS and between CWS-eRec-TS
and CWS-ePer-TS were not significant for any rhyme
production strategies, including the nonword correct
strategy. This indicates that strategy use was similar for
CWNS and CWS-eRec-TS and for CWS-eRec-TS and
CWS-ePer-TS. For further description and to under-
stand how CWS-eRec-TS compared to the other groups,
proportion of strategy use for each group was calculated

and is illustrated in Figure 4. CWS-ePer-TS used the
nonword correct strategy on 44% of trials, whereas
CWNS used it on 32% of trials. CWNS used the real-word
correct strategy on 33% of trials, whereas CWS-ePer-TS
used it on 16% of the trials. Although CWS-ePer-TS per-
formed with the same accuracy as CWNS on the rhyme
production task, they relied more heavily on the nonword
correct strategy than CWNS. CWS-eRec-TS used the
nonword correct strategy on 32% of trials, which was the
same percentage as CWNS; however, they fell between
CWNS and CWS-ePer-TS on use of the real-word correct
strategy at 26% of trials. CWS-eRec-SSD and CWS-ePer-
SSD relied on the repeated cues strategy at 35% and 34%
of trials, respectively. By comparison, CWNS used repeated
cues on only 4% of trials. All groups were similar in their
use of the semantic association strategy, ranging from 7%
to 15% in each group.

For correct trials, individual patterns of strategy use
were also explored. Figure 5 shows the percentage of indi-
viduals within each group using the real-word and non-
word strategy equally (RW = NW), the real-word strategy
more often than the nonword strategy (RW > NW), and
the nonword strategy more than the real-word strategy
(RW < NW). Also illustrated is the percentage of individ-
uals in each group that did not obtain any correct trials.
CWNS and CWS-eRec-TS showed mixed patterns of strat-
egy use on correct trials, with a majority of the individuals
using RW > NW; however, each of the participants in the
CWS-ePer-TS group with correct trials used the nonword
correct strategy more often than the real-word correct
strategy (RW < NW). Similarly, all CWS-ePer-SSD with
correct trials used the nonword correct strategy equally

Discussion

The primary aim of the current study was to examine

the developing phonological awareness of 4- to 5-year-old
CWS in relation to eventual recovery or persistence in
stuttering. The current study evaluated whether proficiency

in rhyme discrimination and rhyme production, as well as
rhyme production strategy use, may help predict recov-
ery or persistence in young CWS. Consistent with previ-
ous estimates, 44% of the current CWS sample demonstrated
a concomitant SSD (Wolk et al., 1990). Therefore, to ac-
count for the influence of SSD on phonological awareness
skills, five groups determined by stuttering outcome and
speech sound development were assessed. Analyses fo-
cused on comparing groups who eventually recovered to

speech, and the lower plot shows groups with speech sound disorder (SSD). Although the groups with typical speech
demonstrated similar performance on the rhyme production task, individual CWNS (children who do not stutter) and
CWS-eRec-TS (children who stutter and eventually recovered with typical speech) demonstrated mixed patterns of
strategy use compared to individual CWS-ePer-TS (children who stutter and eventually persisted with typical speech).
None of the individual CWS-ePer-TS or CWS-ePer-SSD (children who stutter and eventually persisted with speech sound
disorder) used the real-word correct strategy more than the nonword correct strategy. CWS-eRec-SSD = children who stutter

those who eventually persisted and comparing CWS groups
to the CWNS group. No group differences were found for
the rhyme discrimination task. Similarly, no differences
were found for rhyme production accuracy between the
groups of CWS who eventually recovered and the groups
of CWS who eventually persisted. However, CWS who also
displayed SSD (CWS-eRec-SSD, CWS-ePer-SSD) performed
less accurately on the rhyme production task compared to

typically fluent controls (CWNS). While the score on the
rhyme production task did not differentiate the CWS who
eventually recovered from those who eventually persisted,
the strategies they used to create rhymes (real word vs. non-
word) distinguished the groups. The CWS who eventually
persisted with typical speech sound development utilized
a nonword rhyme production strategy to a greater extent
than the typically fluent control children.

Differences between groups of interest did not reach

significance on the rhyme discrimination task. All group
means were above chance, and 69 of the children (81% of
the sample) scored above chance on the task. The high accu-
racy of the large majority of the sample suggests that most
participants at this age had phonological representations that
were refined at least to the level of onset and rime resulting
in accurate rhyme judgments. However, 16 children (19% of
the sample) scored at or below chance. This finding suggests
that the rhyme discrimination skill was still developing at
this age in some of the participants, both CWNS and CWS.
The results of the rhyme discrimination task utilized
in the current study indicate that the majority of participants,
both CWNS and CWS, had developed basic detection abili-
ties. The rhyme discrimination task required analysis and
judgment of two stimulus words and a simple “yes” or “no”
response. It is possible that other rhyme awareness tasks that
require additional phonological analyses may have revealed
group differences. Previous studies of children with typical
development investigated rhyme awareness between 2 and
5 years of age with tasks such as rhyme oddity and rhyme
matching, which required analysis and comparison of up to
four stimulus words (Carroll et al., 2003; Corriveau et al.,
2010; Lonigan et al., 1998; Maclean et al., 1987). These
studies suggest that many children within our 4- to 5-year
age range could complete rhyme judgment tasks with greater
complexity. Also, the current rhyme discrimination task
tested phonological representations at the level of onset and
rime. Testing a further refined representation, such as indi-
vidual phonemes, would be more challenging for children
at this age and therefore may result in greater variability in
task accuracy. Specifically, a more challenging task may re-
sult in more scores toward the midrange, which we did not
see in the skewed and bimodal distributions. It is also possi-
ble that a more graded measure of rhyme processing, such
as ERPs, could detect group differences. The behavioral
measures used in the current study focus only on response
accuracy, whereas ERPs can index subtle differences in un-
derlying neural activity and have resulted in differences re-
lated to recovery and persistence in stuttering (Mohan &
Weber, 2015).

Rhyme Production
Accuracy

No differences in rhyme production accuracy were
found when comparing groups with similar speech sound
development. The three groups with typical speech scored
similarly to one another as did the two groups with SSD.
However, both CWS groups with SSD scored lower than
CWNS. Lower performance by children with SSD com-
pared to CWNS on phonological awareness tasks is consis-
tent with previous findings that indicated this population
may have poorly specified phonological representations,
which lead to difficulty in phonological awareness (Anthony
et al., 2011; Rvachew, 2006).

Strategy

Strategies used to formulate and produce rhymes
differentiated groups with typical speech sound develop-
ment. While the CWS-ePer-TS group performed with the
same rhyme production accuracy compared to the CWNS
group, they relied more heavily on the nonword correct
strategy. As a group, CWS-ePer-TS used the nonword cor-
rect strategy at approximately twice the rate of CWNS.
No differences were noted in the use of rhyme production
strategies between CWS-eRec-TS and CWNS.

The difference in use of the real-word and nonword
strategies may be due to factors such as the activation and
organization of phonological networks within the lexicon.
The rhyme production task required the participant to lis-
ten to the stimulus, analyze the acoustic–phonetic represen-
tation of the stimulus, identify the rime, generate that rime
in a new form, access the articulatory–phonetic representa-
tion for that form, and finally produce a response. The
lexical restructuring hypothesis predicts that, upon hearing
the stimulus word, a child may activate a network of pho-
nological representations in the mental lexicon, which sound
similar to the stimulus (same initial phoneme, onset, rime,
etc.; Metsala, 1997). If a child’s phonological representa-
tions are organized around common sublexical units, an
efficient approach to the rhyme production task would be
to search the activated network for a word that rhymes. This
approach would result in the real-word correct strategy. How-
ever, none of the 82 children completed the rhyme produc-
tion task using the real-word strategy exclusively. In fact,
individuals in each group showed different patterns of real-
word correct and nonword correct strategy use. Forty-one
percent of CWNS and 22% of CWS-eRec-TS used real-word
correct strategy more often than the nonword correct strat-
egy. However, each of the CWS-ePer-TS with correct re-
sponses used the nonword correct strategy more often than
the real-word correct strategy. The difference in patterns of
strategy use suggests that, as a group, CWS-ePer-TS have
phonological representations that may be underspecified
compared to their CWNS peers. Specifically, refinement
and flexibility of phonological representations may play a
role in the differences in rhyme production strategy between
groups. This idea is supported by other studies in which
CWS were challenged by processing and manipulating pho-
nological representations. Byrd, Conture, and Ohde (2007)
used priming to suggest that CWS are delayed in their tran-
sition from processing words holistically to processing
words as a combination of phonemes (incrementally).
Three- and 5-year-old CWS demonstrated a faster speech
onset for primes, which provided a majority of the word
(holistic), as compared to primes, which provided only the
first phoneme (incremental). Three-year-old CWNS were
primed more by the holistic prime, but five-year-old CWNS
showed a preference for the incremental prime (Byrd et al.,
2007). The delay in transition from holistic to incremental
processing in CWS may indicate less refinement and flex-
ibility in their phonological representations. In addition,
Spencer and Weber-Fox (2014) demonstrated that nonword
repetition and performance on the BBTOP were predictors

Gerwin et al.: Rhyme Production Strategies and Stuttering Outcome 3315

Downloaded from: https://pubs.asha.org Michigan State University on 11/11/2025, Terms of Use: https://pubs.asha.org/pubs/rights_and_permissions of recovery and persistence. CWS-ePer scored lower than
their peers who would recover on the nonword repetition
measure and the test of articulation accuracy. As mentioned
in the introduction, higher accuracy on nonword repetition
may indicate robust phonological representations, which
are more accurately combined and repeated (Edwards et al.,
2004). The lower performance by CWS-ePer on nonword
repetition supports the idea that their phonological represen-
tations may not be as well specified. If CWS-ePer-TS do
not have flexible, refined phonological representations, they
may have difficulty separating and manipulating the onset
and rime in order to produce a real-word rhyme.

A second factor, which may contribute to the differ-
ences in rhyming strategy used by CWS-ePer-TS, is ease of
phonological access. Neural activity underlying rhyme
discrimination, as measured by ERPs, differentiated 7- and
8-year-old children who had recovered from stuttering and
children who were persisting (Mohan & Weber, 2015).
Specifically, children who were persisting did not demon-
strate the anterior onset rhyme effect to the second word
of the stimulus pair (target word). The anterior onset rhyme
effect was hypothesized to facilitate phonological access to
the representation of the target word in rhyming pairs as
compared to nonrhyming pairs. In other words, the first
word of the pair (prime word) is thought to activate a net-
work of similar sounding words, which could include the
rhyming target word. When the target word rhymes with
the prime, this activation is reflected in an early increase in
mean amplitude over frontal parietal sites, the early onset
rhyme effect. The authors indicate that the absence of the
early onset rhyme effect in CWS who were persisting may
reflect less saliency of the phonological representation of
the prime. If the prime is not salient or maintained in mem-
ory, it may not activate the phonological network containing
the target allowing for efficient access to the phonological
representation of the target. These findings suggest that
CWS-ePer-TS in the current study may not as easily acti-
vate a network of phonologically related words in response
to the stimulus word. It is reasonable to hypothesize that
a lack of efficient phonological access to the lexicon led
these children to produce real-word responses less frequently
than CWNS.

Related to the idea of access to the lexicon, it is
possible that semantic processing may also play a role
in the increased use of a nonword correct strategy in the
CWS-ePer-TS group given the overlap and interactions
of phonological and lexical networks (Edwards, Munson,
& Beckman, 2011). However, we speculate that the group
differences in the current study were more likely related to
phonological processing for several reasons. First, our
rhyming tasks are known to reflect phonological awareness
abilities (e.g., Anthony et al., 2003; Mohan & Weber,
2015). In addition, the groups were matched on vocabu-
lary. This matching was important due to the relationship
between vocabulary growth and development of phono-
logical awareness (Metsala, 1997); therefore, the groups
in this study have similarly sized lexicons from which to
produce real words that rhyme. Second, previous work in

5-year-old CWS and CWNS indicated that CWS-eRec
showed a more mature pattern of processing related to
semantic anomalies while CWS-ePer showed similar
processing to CWNS (Kreidler, Wray, Usler, & Weber,
2017). Given the similar semantic processing of CWS-ePer
and CWNS in that study, it does not seem likely that se-
mantic processing alone would account for the group dif-
ferences found in the use of the nonword correct strategy.
Finally, none of the group comparisons revealed differ-
ences in the use of the semantic association strategy. Use
of the semantic association strategy implies the ability to
provide words that are related based on their meaning
(e.g., “water” as a response to the prompt “shower”). If
a semantic deficit influenced performance of CWS-ePer-TS,
we might expect them to show decreased use of the seman-
tic association strategy compared to the other groups. For
these reasons, we speculate that the group differences in the
current study are related primarily to differences in phono-
logical processing.

Conclusions

The current study sought to further our understand-
ing of developing phonology as a factor that may help to
predict whether a young child will recover or persist in
stuttering. Speech sound production abilities were taken
into account given the relationship between SSD and
phonological awareness. We found that CWS with typical
speech sound development complete rhyme discrimina-
tion and rhyme production tasks with the same accuracy
as their typically fluent peers. However, CWS-ePer-TS
achieved accuracy on the rhyme production task by creat-
ing nonwords that rhyme as opposed to real words to a
much larger extent. This reliance on a nonword strategy
may reflect differences in underlying phonological repre-
sentations and differences in ease of phonological access
to the lexicon.

How do these findings relate to the MDP theory of

stuttering and eventual recovery or persistence? Developing
phonology is one of the linguistic factors considered in the
MDP, which may develop to either support or interfere
with speech motor stabilization in CWS (Smith & Weber,
2017). The current study demonstrates that rhyme produc-
tion strategy at 4 and 5 years of age may help differentiate
children who will recover from stuttering from those who
will persist. Our findings, in combination with past re-
search, suggest that CWS-ePer-TS may have less refined
phonological representations and less efficient phonologi-
cal access to the lexicon. These differences in phonologi-
cal processing in CWS-ePer-TS may be one of the additional
taxes on the overall speech motor system that interfere
with speech motor stabilization and the establishment of
fluent speech (Smith & Weber, 2017).

Limitations and Future Directions

Findings from the current study added to our un-

derstanding of the relationship between phonological

continue to investigate not only performance scores on
phonological tasks but also underlying task strategies or
neural processes. Research is underway to investigate the
underlying neural activity mediating phonological process-
ing in CWS at ages 4 and 5 years. In addition, future
studies may investigate more complex phonological aware-
ness tasks in CWS within this age range by altering phono-
logical unit and task. For example, studies may investigate
further refinement of phonological representations using
detection and production tasks at the level of the phoneme.
As suggested by Byrd et al. (2007), CWS may be delayed in
refined, incremental processing of phonological representa-
tions that could impact speech production.

Findings from the current study also added to our

understanding of the relationship between the presence of
SSD and development of phonological awareness in the
CWS population. Future research may continue to explore
the smaller subpopulation of CWS who have a concomi-
tant SSD. Specifically, research may compare CWS with
SSD to CWNS with SSD. The current study did not in-
clude CWNS with SSD, and therefore, we cannot indicate
whether decreased rhyme production accuracy in CWS
groups with SSD was related solely to SSD or to both dis-
orders. However, future studies including CWS with SSD,
CWNS with SSD, and CWNS without SSD could provide
insight into the development and processing of phonologi-
cal representations in distinct speech production disorders.
Future studies of phonological development in these popu-
lations may also include a measure of speech perception.
The current study included a measure of vocabulary; how-
ever, speech perception has also been shown to influence
the development of phonological awareness (Rvachew &
Grawburg, 2006).

Finally, future studies may include an even larger

sample size, particularly when looking at the subpopula-
tions of CWS with concomitant SSD. Our study was de-
signed to collect a large, representative sample of CWS.
This sample clearly represents the heterogeneous features
of the CWS population; however, a larger sample size with
increased power for group comparisons may have revealed
additional group differences that did not reach significance
after conservative corrections for multiple comparisons.
