Purpose: The present
Logop€adie, Phonetik, H€or-Wahrnehmungstraining, Intensit€at, nasaler Schwingungsakzent) speech treat-
ment for children and adolescents who stutter, an approach using fluency shaping with an intensive
time schedule and group sessions.
Methods: Participants were 42 male and 14 female persons who stuttered with a median age of
13.0 years. Participants and their parents completed the strength and difficulties questionnaire at the
beginning of the therapy and 1 year later. Participants completed the Speech Questionnaire, an instru-
ment to measure the impact of stuttering, twice before and twice after completing the therapy. The
stuttering rate and mean length of the three longest stuttering events were studied four times in vid-
eos of interviews, reading texts and three telephone calls. Outcomes are reported for the 56 children
and young adults who stuttered and who completed D.E.L.P.H.I.N. The main analysis was performed
using linear mixed models.
Results: Quality of life as measured in the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) – filled in by
the participants/their parents – increased significantly from before the start of the therapy to 1 year
after completion of the therapy. The subjective rating of the impact of stuttering also improved signifi-
cantly. The stuttering rate and mean length of the longest stuttering event decreased significantly for
all three modes from pre-treatment to 12 months post-treatment.
Conclusions: After D.E.L.P.H.I.N., a significant improvement of the relevant endpoints quality of life,
impact of stuttering, and severity of stuttering is observed.

Introduction

Stuttering is a common speech disorder in all ages. A life-
time incidence of 5% is the most consistently reported stat-
istic. Recent data suggest an even higher incidence, close to
10% [1]. The incidence of this disorder varies according to
age group. Up to 90% of children who stutter will recover
during childhood. During adulthood, <1% is affected [1].
Stuttering treatment is most successful during pre-school
years. With increasing age, outcomes are less positive [2–8].
Treatment of children who stutter has changed during
the last 30 years. In earlier years, a “hands-off” attitude was
preferred. Now, there is a consensus that early intervention
should be practised [9] although there is still a debate about
the preferred approach. Multifactorial treatment strategies
try to identify the stressors of the child and to modify the
environmental stressors. Many pre-school children who stut-
ter have been treated based on the Demands and Capacities
Model [10]. This approach aims to decrease the demands
set by the environment and the child him- or herself, and to
increase the child’s capacities for speaking fluently. In con-
trast, the Lidcombe Program [11] uses operant conditioning
techniques to teach parents to verbalise positive and nega-
tive responses to their child’s speech.

As stuttering has a widespread impact on the life of the
affected, a treatment is mandatory. Stuttering children have
more negative attitudes to communication than their peers
and those attitudes to communication worsen progressively
during the school years [12,13]. Adolescents who missed the
window of opportunity for treatment during pre-school and
early school age or underwent one or more therapies with-
out sufficient effect experience or anticipate problems enter-
ing professional life or beginning university studies.

School children who stutter are often chronically bullied
because of their stuttering. Blood and Blood found that 11-
to 12-year-old children who stutter have a 63% risk of bully-
ing compared to 22% for controls [14]. Another report of
28 stuttering children aged 7–15 years found that 59% of
them reported being bullied and 38% reported bullying to
have occurred on most days or every day [15]. Gladstone
and his colleagues [16] found that bullying during the
school years is strongly associated with subsequent anxiety
emerging during early adolescence. Adolescents who stutter
score more highly than adolescents who do not stutter on
the measures of communication apprehension and view
themselves as being less able communicators than their flu-
[17]. Craig and Tran [18] concluded that

adolescents who stutter are more likely to become more shy,
socially avoidant, and fearful of communication than their
fluent peers, and to develop pervasive negative attitudes and
beliefs about themselves as communicators. As persistent
stuttering in adolescents and adults can have a serious men-
tal and social impact [14,15], therapy should also be consid-
ered for older children and adolescents who still stutter if
the patient is willing to participate. Treatment of adolescents
who stutter is an under-researched area [3].

Earlier studies about adolescents reported improvements
after therapy based on speech restructuring using either
smooth speech [19] or prolonged speech [20]. Speech
restructuring has also been shown to be effective in the
frame of intensive treatment programs [21], or integrated
with cognitive-behaviour therapy [22].

Speech therapy remains the treatment of choice, also for
adults. Other treatment options,
for example, pharmaco-
logical treatment, have not been shown to be effective in
any well-designed study.

In addition, speech-restructuring treatments are generally
not well accepted by adolescents and young adults. Clients
are often inconsistent in applying new speech patterns, and
thus decreasing the effectiveness of the treatment. Hearne
et al. [20] conjectured that adolescents who stutter might
prefer to stutter rather than to use a technique to control
stuttering that involved decreasing rate and/or naturalness
of speech. Adolescents may be reluctant to use an unnatural
speech pattern with their peers or at school as this draws
attention to the speaker, which in turn may increase
social anxiety.

the
Comprehensive Stuttering Programme, which included pro-
longed speech, cognitive and social training, self-generated
home maintenance programmes, and refresher clinics. This
led to a reduction in stuttering severity (69% maintained a
satisfactory level of post-treatment fluency, an additional 7%
a marginally satisfactory level) and 80% of the subjects rated
their speech fluency as good or fair 12–24 months after
treatment [21].

A question often discussed is whether the treatment of
stuttering should be intensive or spaced over intervals.
Intensive therapy is said to accelerate the acquisition of a
new speech technique, but with a higher risk of relapse,
whereas interval training may lead to slower acquisition, but
also slower extinction of the new skills. James et al. [23]
included 20 adult and adolescent stutterers (age, 19–50 years)
and compared 16 2-h sessions of fluency training adminis-
tered within 4 days to 2-h sessions twice per week for
8 weeks. Both treatment
formats were equivalent on
all measures.

Ryan and Ryan [24] conducted a treatment comparison
study. Twelve children and adolescents (age, 7–17 years)
were assigned to the “Gradual
Increase in Length and
Complexity of Utterance” programme, with nine of them
completing the programme. Of these, six children achieved
a near zero stuttering rate. Twelve other subjects aged
7–17 years were assigned to Delayed Auditory Feedback,
them completing the therapy. The authors
with five of

report that 11 subjects from both groups, who completed
the Transfer and Maintenance Programs, reduced their stut-
tering from 7.9 stuttered words per minute to 0.8 stuttered
words per minute at a 14-month follow-up.

Craig et al. [19] conducted a prospective study and
compared four groups of 9- to 14-year-old children with
stuttering. Twenty-seven of them received an intensive flu-
ency-shaping technique using a variant of prolonged speech
called smooth speech; 25 a home-based smooth speech, a
less
intensive fluency-shaping technique combined with
child/parent interaction therapy; and 25 received electro-
myography feedback. The 20 children who were in the no-
treatment control group received therapy after 3 months. All
three experimental groups were significantly better than the
control group and there was no significant difference
between the experimental groups up to 1 year after the
treatment. In the study conducted by Hancock et al. [25],
62 of the 77 subjects who had participated in the first study
could be examined 2–6 years after treatment. The percentage
of
to those
recorded 1 year post-treatment. Nobody’s treatment had
superior treatment efficacy. The speech rate per minute was
significantly higher than 1 year post-treatment, again with
no differences between the treatment groups. Speech natur-
alness was the same for all treatment groups and over time
in the view of the patients and the therapists; only the
parents tended to rate the children’s speech as less natural
during follow-up.

Laiho and Klippi [26] studied 21 children/adolescents
who stutter and 29 of their mothers/fathers in intensive
therapy courses including stuttering modification and paren-
tal guidance. The percentage of syllables stuttered dropped
in the case of two-thirds of the participants and most partic-
ipants and parents reported that the positive changes in
stuttering behaviour had continued up to 9 months after
the therapy.

An adaption of the Camperdown Programme that had
previously been used in adults was used in three adolescents
aged 13, 14, and 16 years by Hearne et al. [20]. One of
them responded well to the treatment, with the percentage
of stuttered syllabels falling to approximately 1% in the
period up to 1 year after the treatment. The second adoles-
cent, who withdrew from the treatment during maintenance,
still had a marked reduction. The third demonstrated a wor-
sening of
the stuttering. The question of whether the
Camperdown Programme can also be applied by webcam
without clinic attendance was studied in three adolescents
aged 13, 15, and 16 years [27]. The webcam service delivery
was appealing to participants and their parents. With a
mean of 11 clinician hours, two participants achieved large
stuttering reductions that did not diminish in the year after
the treatment; one participant failed to maintain treatment
gains during the 12 months follow-up period.

In the phase II trial [28], 16 adolescents aged 12–17 years
were included. For the group as a whole, stuttering was
reduced in terms of frequency and severity, but it was only
efficacious and efficient for half of the group.

Hewat et al.

[29] developed another treatment pro-
gramme for adolescents and adults who stutter. Based on
the operant procedure of self-imposed time-out (SITO), the
participants learned to stop speaking for a short period after
each stutter. More than half of the participants reduced
their stuttering by more than 50%. Of the 30 participants,
four were adolescents (age, 12–17 years). One of these failed
to respond to SITO; another was unable to learn SITO. The
two other adolescents both reached a significant reduction
of the stuttering rate.

Maintenance of treatment effects after a period of inten-
sive training was studied by Cream et al. [30]. Eighty-nine
participants aged between 12 and 74 years received five con-
secutive days of intensive group speech-restructuring treat-
seven
followed by a maintenance programme of
ment
weekly clinic visits. For each participant of the experimental
group, an individual target video of 4 min 30 s was pro-
duced. The participants were instructed to watch the whole
video each day for 4 weeks and to talk parallel without stut-
tering, but only half of the participants actually watched
their video every day. As participants in the experimental
group demonstrated no advantage in the percentage of SS,
but did report a better self-rating of the stuttering and their
quality of life, the authors concluded that additional video
self-modeling could be a useful adjunct to standard speech-
restructuring treatment.

Fifteen children in the case group were compared to a con-
trol group in a randomized design. Those from the case
group showed not only a lower reaction time after the inter-

concluded that
inhibitory control and better
emotion regulation may contribute to this effect [31].

Fry and her group [32] investigated whether an intensive
treatment programme for older teenagers who stutter is
effective in reducing overt and covert aspects of stuttering.
They included three males aged 17;7, 17;11, and 18;10 years.
One participant completed all required recordings. They
found a significant trend of reduced frequency of stuttering
for all three participants during the intensive therapy phase.
This trend continued throughout the consolidation phase
and remained significant up to 9 months after the intensive
therapy in the case of the first participant. Participants also
reported increased self-efficacy about speaking and reduced
overt and covert aspects of stuttering.

by Yairi and Ambrose [33] and Bloodstein and Bernstein-
Ratner [34]. Nye and Hahs-Vaughn [35] provided an ana-

Information about the effect of stuttering treatment in

Germany has been sparse up to now.

Baumeister et al. [43] studied the effect of a German stut-
tering therapy summer camp under practice conditions.
Forty participants aged 9–19 years were taught a more open
handling of their stuttering and received fluency shaping
and stuttering modification therapy. Participants <12 years
stayed in the camp for 2 weeks; older participants for
3 weeks. The intention of the camp was to lay a basis for
future therapies, not to replace other modes of therapy. In
terms of percentage of SS, speech rate and naturalness of
speech, an improvement could be measured up to 2 months
after the camp.

Metten et al. [44] investigated 19 children and adoles-
cents aged 9–19 years who participated in an intensive stut-
tering treatment in a summer camp for 3 weeks (treatment
to Rosenberger). The severity of stuttering and the
acc.
impact of stuttering on life quality showed improvements in
the 10 months after the intensive therapy compared with
the results before the treatment.

The Kassel Stuttering Therapy (KST) is a computer-
assisted German adaptation of fluency shaping. Out of 400
clients (age, 9–65 years) who completed the 2- to 3-week in-
long-term data after 1 year

(n ¼ 238), 2 years
(n ¼ 69) were
and 3 years
reported [45]. The changes of disfluency from before ther-
apy to 1 year or more after therapy showed effect sizes of
d > 1.1. The results after 2 and 3 years were correlated to
those after 1 year. Studying the effects of the KST in 32 chil-
dren aged 9–13 years, the average reduction in dysfluencies
in the children was similar to the effects in adults, but the
spread of outcomes was wider. The parents rated the success
lower than the children themselves [46].

The D.E.L.P.H.I.N. speech treatment

for children and
adolescents who stutter [47] now has a long tradition in
Germany, but its efficacy and efficiency have not yet been
assessed. In order to assess the development of the stutter-
ing symptoms, the impact of stuttering on quality of life,
but also the drop-out rate, we planned a prospective study
(compare Table 1) using questionnaires, standardised videos

intensive therapy. As stuttering therapies should lead to a
stable effect, we conducted the last examination 1 year after
the intensive therapy.

D.E.L.P.H.I.N. speech treatment for children and
adolescents who stutter

This speech treatment aims at older children and adoles-
cents who stutter severely with a high psychological strain
and a high motivation to work continuously on their
speech. Additionally, a relative (often a parent) must be pre-
pared to follow the therapy and the training at home. This
speech treatment is rooted in an in-patient stuttering ther-
apy for children with special needs as practised in a residen-
tial school in Hamburg, Germany. There the patients stayed
for 1 year without their parents and pupils had to repeat the
year at school. Sch€utz copied this kind of therapy in a com-
the “Sprachheilzentrum Gieszen” and
parable institution,
then modified it into to an intensive therapy with integra-
tion of the parents.

The treatment consists of an initial assessment session,
24 days of in-patient intensive treatment in groups of 7–10
similarly-aged persons, and follow-up care about 6 and
12 months afterwards. In between, patients must carry out

daily homework and conference calls (via skype) with other
participants. The D.E.L.P.H.I.N. method is named after the
initials of its components: Deblocking impulse, relaxation
pathology
(German:

ing, Intensity, and Nasal swinging accent [47].

The patient learns a completely new speech pattern in

three main steps:
The first goal

is the acquisition of costo-abdominal
breathing, as many patients suffer from tension in the chest
region. Then the patient is taught in one-on-one-sessions
what Sch€utz calls the “deblocking impulse,” a kind of sigh, a
letting go. The deblocking impulse is formed without pres-
sure. It leads to a relaxation of the region around the larynx
and impedes a cramping of the false and true vocal folds.
This deblocking impulse should be used in every syllable
with the main accent. This technique is practised through-
out the whole therapy, during meals, talking to the parent
or to other patients. It
impedes stuttering and physical
movements. Approximately, 5 days later, the second step
follows. Now the patient learns what Sch€utz calls “nasal
swinging accent”: a gentle voice onset with nasal character
in words beginning with a vowel. The nasal character facili-
tates
the
“deblocking impulse” and the “nasal swinging accent,” in
the beginning exaggerating both. Using these techniques,
patients realise that they can prevent and impede stuttering
when they use this speech modification technique, but that
the
it demands constant awareness and performing of
speech pattern. During this
second step, patients are
exposed to stressful situations such as shopping, telephone
calls,
lectures, reciting of poems, discussions, speaking in
noise, questions to unknown persons, interviews, or order-
ing in a restaurant to practise the technique. During the
third week, the length and magnitude of the “deblocking
impulse” and of the “nasal swinging accent” are decreased,
leading to a more and more natural speech. In addition to
the one-on-one therapy and group sessions, patients also
work in the speech laboratory. Here they wear headphones
to dampen the ambient noise. Patients have texts with
marks for the “deblocking impulse” and the “nasal swinging
accent” and read these texts aloud using the speech tech-
nique. This is recorded and then patients listen to them-
selves

Additionally, videos of the training in different situations

During the intensive therapy, a patient attends 140 sessions
(mostly group sessions). Additionally, every day patients
participate in sessions of progressive muscle relaxation
according to Jacobson. These instructions are given in the
speech technique. Furthermore,

European drum sessions to foster sense of community and
to improve concentration and coordination skills. In con-

to African drum playing, where the right hand is
mainly used, here the player alternates from one hand to
the other after each beat; both halves of the brain are acti-
vated and are said to be better connected. During the drum
sessions, the speech technique is used, and for some patients
the movement of the hands facilitates the speech technique.
The patients internalise the speech technique more rapidly.
The patients take part in three to four sessions a week and

speech modification technique at home,
patients are furthermore required to be supervised by an
adult. During intensive treatment, adults are taught how to
monitor and correct the patient’s speech in order to prepare
them for their supervisory role at home. The patient’s
school or workplace is informed about the speech technique
to help facilitate the transfer to daily life there. The patient
gives a lecture on the first day after the intensive therapy.
During the 2 years after the intensive therapy, the patient
has maximally 2 weeks and four single days for the stabilisa-
tion phase, usually 50–80 logopedic sessions. The speech
technique the patients use is the same for all age groups.
The texts used are adapted to the specific age group. In the
therapy of children, the work of the parents is more relevant
as children can monitor themselves less reliably. In adoles-
cents, psychosocial burden and anxiety are more important.
For this reason, training of real situations is more often
practised. To date,
this intensive therapy has only been
delivered by the developer and her daughter. A treatment
protocol is not publicly available. The courses of instruction
for other therapists lasting 1 year are planned for the future.
So far, the developer and her daughter have also brought
their therapy to South Africa, where treatment was con-
ducted in English.

Participants

Participants were 56 school-age children, adolescents, and
mainly young adults aged 8–36 years (mean, 15.3; median,
13.0; SD, 6.4 years), most of them previously diagnosed as
stuttering severely. Forty-two participants were males and
14 females. All 56 participants who attended the treatment
between 1 January 2014 and 15 February 2015 gave their
consent to take part in the study. Three participants stopped
the treatment prematurely. Patients were conjoined in
groups of similar age irrespective of their gender or the
severity of the stuttering. Group 1/14, 2/14, 3/14, and 1/15

comprised 10 participants, group 4/15 7 participants, and
group 5/15 9 participants.

Nearly, all participants had previously had undergone
stuttering treatment (49 out of 51; for five participants no
information about preceding therapy was available), 29 of
whom had had more than one course of treatment. In most
cases (20) therapy had been conducted once a week, in 17
cases twice weekly, in 11 cases three times weekly and in
four cases more often than that. For 27 of the participants,
a history of receptive and expressive language disorder was
reported. Other comorbidities were attention-deficit hyper-
activity (HA) disorder in three, perception disorders in four,
learning disability in six, and motoric disorders in six par-
ticipants. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee
of the Federal Medical Association. All participants and all
parents signed informed consent forms.

Methods

A repeated-measures design was used. As summarized in
Table 1, four outcome measures were used.

General quality of life in the view of the participants and
in the view of the parents was assessed before treatment
(T3) and 1 year after treatment (T7) using the Strength and
Difficulty Questionnaire (SDQ) [48–50]. The Fragebogen
zum Sprechen (FzS) – Speech Questionnaire [51] was com-
pleted twice (T1, T3) before treatment (the diagnosis sched-
ule and the first day of treatment) and twice after treatment
(T4, T7), once on the last day of intensive treatment and
once 1 year later.

The number of syllables stuttered and the mean length of
the three longest stuttering events were assessed during
interviews (T1, T3, T4, T7), text reading (T1, T3, T4, T7),
and telephone calls (T2, T5, T6). The interval between T2
(telephone call after agreeing to participate but before the
beginning of the intensive treatment) and the beginning of
the treatment was 35.0 days (mean and median, SD 17.6),
that between the end of the intensive therapy (T4) and the
first telephone call after this therapy was 120.4 ± 21.3 days
(mean ± SD; median: 117), and that between the end of the
intensive therapy (T4) and the last telephone call after this
therapy was 336.5 ± 9.7 days (mean ± SD; median: 335). For
the calculations of the percentage of syllables stuttered and
the mean length of the longest stuttering events, both assess-
ments before the treatment (T1 for interview, text reading,
and T2 for telephone call) and both assessments in the long
term (T6 for telephone call and T7 for interview and read-
ing) were summarised.

Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire

The SDQ is a short questionnaire that addresses positive
and negative behavioural attributes of children or adoles-
cents [48–50]. Its good psychometric properties have been
confirmed by many studies worldwide. The 25-item rating
scale addresses emotional symptoms (ES), HA, inattention-
conduct problems (CP), peer problems (PP), and pro-social
altruism). During

development, special attention was given to a well-balanced
inclusion of both positive and negative behavioural aspects,
items need to be
and hence the raw scores of several
inverted before they are summed up to scale values. The
scores of ES, HA, CP, and PP are summarised to the “Total
Difficulty Score”. Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire
versions are available for parents, teachers, and as self-rat-
ings for children aged 7 years and older. There are three
response categories: 0 ¼ not true, 1 ¼ somewhat true, and
2 ¼ certainly true. As demonstrated by Becker and co-work-
ers [50], the presence of any clinical diagnosis of psycho-
pathology is mirrored by significantly elevated scores in all
SDQ scales. Cut-off values (based on normative SDQ scor-
ing bands) allow discrimination between clinical cases (high
difficulties, distinct mental health disorders), non-cases (low
difficulties, normal), and borderline cases (medium difficul-
ties, between normal and clinical). About 10% of the partici-
pants in the norm sample were classified as clinical cases,
10% as borderline cases, and 80% as normal. The SDQ has
been translated and validated for the German language [50]
with German norms for the parent ratings [48,49]. For the
scoring, actual norms taken from the SDQ homepage were
used. We used the total score as described in the manual,
subscales “emotional,” “conduct,”
summarising the four
“HA,” and “peer,” but not “prosocial.” We used only those
questionnaires in which in each subscale at least 60% of the
items were marked. For our further calculations, we did not
use the classification as normal, borderline, or clinical case
but instead the raw values.

Fragebogen zum sprechen – speech questionnaire

The Speech Questionnaire was developed and validated by
Cook [51] to measure the impact of stuttering on the lives
of children and adolescents aged 8–17 years. Cook aimed to
the
develop an assessment based on the framework of
International Classification of Functioning (ICF). The ICF
describes all health-related experiences in terms of structure
and function of the body and the activities a person might
engage in during participation in daily life.

Yaruss and Quesal [52] adapted the ICF framework to
the study of stuttering. Following these authors, stuttering
must be looked at in terms of several interacting compo-
nents, not only the impairment in body function indicated
by the observable characteristics of stuttering but also:

(cid:2) the speaker’s affective, behavioural, and cognitive reac-

tions to stuttering;

(cid:2) the effects of the environment on stuttering, indicated by
difficulty in different speaking situations and reactions
of others;
(cid:2) the overall

impact of stuttering on the speaker’s life,
indicated by limitations in communication activities and
restrictions in participation in daily life.

Taking these components into account, Cook developed
a short instrument of 27 items with a 6-point Likert scale
[51]. The questionnaire covers attitudes towards life as a

person who stutters (five items), emotions when stuttering
(seven items), different speaking situations (eight
items),
and the impact of stuttering on school performance, friend-
ship, and the ability to achieve one’s own goals (seven
items). The direction of the answers was changed – in some
the highest agreement corresponded to a major handicap; in
other items to the absence of a handicap. The absolute total
score can vary between 27 and 162,
lower values corre-
sponding to a low psychosocial load of the stuttering and
higher values as an expression of a high burden. In a study
with 147 children and adolescents, Cook found that the FzS
is a reliable and valid instrument
for measurement of
health-related quality of life. Comparing the results of the
questionnaire to those of the Stuttering Severity Instrument-
3, Cook proposed a classification of total scores into nine
degrees of severity.

For the English language, the Assessment of the Child’s
Experience with Stuttering (ACES) was developed by Yaruss
and Quesal [52–54]. This questionnaire comprises 98 ques-
tions and collects information about general perspectives on
stuttering, affective, behavioural, and cognitive reactions to
stuttering, functional communication difficulties, and impact
of stuttering on the speaker’s quality of life. This question-
naire was translated into German by Metten et al. [44], but
was judged to be too long for our purposes. The German
version of OASES-T for teenagers was not available at the
start of the study. For these reasons, the Fragebogen zum
Sprechen (FzS) was used for this study. Participants com-
pleted the FzS at baseline, on the first and last day of the
intensive treatment and 1 year after completing the therapy.
For our further calculations, we used the raw values.

Percentage of SS and mean length of the three longest
stuttering events

As part of the clinical routine, standardised situations are
video documented about 6–2 months before
treatment
(when the participants present themselves at the therapy
centre to decide whether an intensive treatment is indicated;
T1), on the first day of the intensive treatment (T3), on the
last day of the intensive treatment (T4) and 1 year after the
intensive treatment (T7). In this study, the videos of inter-
views with semi-standardised questions and text reading
were used for further analysis.

Additionally, beyond-clinic audio recordings were made
of the participant’s speech during telephone conversations
with a caller unknown to the participant or parent (T2, T5,
T6). All telephone calls were made to a home landline or to
a mobile phone. The caller was a research assistant at the
university clinic who recorded the
conversation over
the phone.

For each mode of speech, the percentage of stuttered syl-
lables (% SS) was calculated for 250 syllables, but not the
very first ones to allow accommodation to the situation. To
determine the mean length of the longest stuttering event,
the file was displayed on a computer with the programme
“Computerized Speech Lab.” The longest stuttering events

were marked and measured, and then the three longest stut-
tering events were used to calculate the mean.

Speech naturalness

Speech naturalness was judged by the speech therapist who
performed the acoustic analysis. As proposed in the SSI-3
[55], we judged distracting sounds, facial grimaces and head
movements in the videos of the interviews on a scale from 0
to 5 (0 ¼ none; 1 ¼ not noticeable unless looking for it;
2 ¼ barely noticeable to casual observer; 3 ¼ distracting;
4 ¼ very distracting; 5 ¼ severe and painful-looking).

In all samples, we also assessed the following three
to

from 0 ¼ normal

scale

acoustic parameters on a
2 ¼ markedly deviant:

1.

2.

3.

(e.g. monotone

– markedly deviant

prosody, which was classified as normal – minimally
deviant
or
exaggerated),
breathing, which was classified as normal – minimally
deviant – markedly deviant (e.g. inspiratory phonation,
speaking on residual air)
tonus during phonation, which was classified as normal
– minimally deviant – markedly deviant
(hyperto-
nus, hypotonus).

Statistics

We conducted all analyses in R V. 3.3.1 (R Foundation for
Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria, 2016) using the
packages lme4 (V. 1.1-15) and lmerTest (V. 2.0-36). The vis-
ualisations were obtained using the package ggplot2 (V.
2.2.1). For descriptive analyses, mean values, SDs, and
median and quartiles were calculated for the four primary
endpoints at baseline (pre-treatment) and about 1 year after
treatment. For the secondary endpoints regarding speech
naturalness, absolute and relative frequencies were calculated
at all time points. For confirmatory analyses, the four out-
come variables SDQ, FzS, stuttering rate, and mean length
of stuttering were tested for a difference at different points
in time (pre-treatment vs. 1 year after treatment). The ana-
lysis was specified before closing the data base.

For the evaluation of statistically significant differences
between the two points in time, a generalisation of ANOVA
with repeated measurements was used. Specifically, separate
linear mixed models for the four endpoints were fitted using
the point in time as a fixed effect. The variables gender, age
group (<17 vs. (cid:3)17) and survey method (depending on
endpoint: self-reported questionnaire/parent-reported ques-
tionnaire for SDQ, personal interview/reading text/telephone
interview for stuttering rate, and mean length of stuttering)
were used in the model as adjusting variables. The assump-
tion that the effect of the treatment is the same in each age
group and gender group was checked beforehand visually.
Additionally, we included the information at all other points
in time, but allowed for a non-linear effect of time. To
model different temporal progressions between survey meth-
ods, we included an interaction between the last point in

LOGOPEDICS PHONIATRICS VOCOLOGY

161

time and the survey method. We expected the values of one
individual and members of the same treatment group to be
dependent. To account for these dependencies, we included
random effects for each individual and each treatment
group, allowing for different intercepts. The model assump-
tions (i.e. normality of residuals) were checked visually.
Marginal p values over the different types of surveys per
endpoint were obtained using a likelihood ratio test compar-
ing models with and without considering the effect of the
last
time point. The estimated effects for the difference
between pre- and 12 months post-treatment are presented
together with standard errors and p values. The assumption
that the treatment effect is the same in both genders and
age groups was checked in a sensitivity analysis (results
not shown).

We used the bootstrap method with 1000 bootstrap sam-
ples to estimate the estimated marginal mean values for a
new individual based on the obtained models. The global
level of significance a was set to 0.05. Using the Bonferroni
method to adjust for multiple comparisons, the four hypoth-
eses were tested on a local
level of significance of 0.0125
using confirmatory methods.

Ethical approval

All procedures performed in studies involving human par-
ticipants were in accordance with the ethical standards of
the institutional and national research committee and with
the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or
comparable ethical standards. The study was approved by
the Ethical Committee of the Federal Medical Association
[Ethikkommission der Landes€arztekammer Rheinland-Pfalz,
Bearbeitungsnummer 837.366.13 (9051-F)]. Informed con-
sent was obtained from all individual participants and all
parents included in the study.

Results

Results at baseline for the questionnaires

The values for the SDQ and the FzS were judged visually as
normally distributed.

Subjective rating of quality of life as given in the SDQ
At baseline, participants reached a total score in the SDQ of
range, 2–26); parents a mean
11.7 ± 5.4 (median 11.0,
10.7 ± 7.4 (median 9.5, range 0–36, 10 missing values).

In their representative study, Woerner et al. [48] deter-
mined cut-off scores and used these to assign each raw
score to one of the three categories (normal (cid:4)15, borderline
16–19, abnormal (cid:3)20 for self-assessment and normal (cid:4)13,
borderline 14–16, abnormal 17–40 for parents). At baseline,
43 participants reached a normal total score in the SDQ, 8 a
borderline one, and 5 an abnormal one. The total scores of
the parents were normal for 29 participants, borderline in
11 cases, and abnormal in 6 cases (10 missing values).

Speech questionnaire (FzS). The FzS was used to assess
self-reported speech pathology and influence of stuttering
on different life situations. The mean value for the whole
group was 106.08 (±24.20, 20 missing values); the median
107. Five participants had a value of max. 80 points, corre-
sponding to a maximally moderate stuttering (percentile
rank, 1–60), four participants reached 81–91 points (moder-
ate to severe, PR 61-77), six were between 92 and 98
(severe, PR 87-88), three between 99 and 106 (severe to very
severe, PR 89-95), and 18 had 107 or more points (very
severe, PR (cid:3)96).

For both the SDQ and the FzS, the values for males were
lower on average than for females (SDQ: –1.31, SE 1.64, p
value .43, FzS: –10.07, SE 3.92, p value .013) and the values
for younger participants were lower on average than for
older ones (SDQ: –1.39, SE 1.20, p value <0.001, FzS:
–18.68, SE 4.72, p value <0.001).

Variation in time for the questionnaires

General quality of life was measured using the SDQ, which
was completed by participants and their parents. The results
for children and adolescents (SDQ self) and their parents
(SDQ parents) on the first day of the intensive treatment
and 12 months after treatment are summarized in Table 2.
These are raw values and should be interpreted with care, as
the correlation between values due to the fact that the same
individuals were observed is not accounted for and the val-
ues are not adjusted for group effects.

We observed on average higher values for older partici-
pants, corresponding to a more reduced quality of life, than
those for younger participants (þ1.39, SE 1.86, p value .46),
and higher values on average for females compared to males

(þ1.32, SE 1.64, p value .43). For the calculations, an adjust-
ment
for age, gender, and method of gathering (self-
reported or parent-reported) was applied. We found a sig-
nificant difference (p < .001) between the values assessed on
the first day of the treatment and 12 months after the treat-
ment, both for the results of the participants (–2.93, SE
0.80) and for those of the parents (–1.66, SE 0.87) adjusted
for age and gender.

The Fragebogen zum Sprechen, the speech questionnaire
(FzS, [51]) was completed by each participant twice before
the therapy (T1, T3), after the intensive therapy (T4), and
1 year later (T7). The values for the whole group are listed
in Table 2. These are raw values, the correlation between
values due to fact that the same individuals were observed is
not accounted for and the values are not adjusted for group
effects. During the study, it turned out that after the initial
treatment some of the test persons did not answer all ques-
tions but noted instead on the questionnaire that they no
longer stuttered and thus found these questions inappropri-
ate for them now. For this reason, the main analysis was
conducted by setting these answers to the best possible
answers meaning that we assumed the participant felt no
impact by his speech in that situation. In a separate sensitiv-

the end of the intensive treatment T4.

Variation in time for the stuttering rate and mean
length of the three longest stuttering events

The stuttering rate and mean length of the three longest
stuttering events were determined via an interview and text
reading twice before therapy, at the end of the intensive
therapy and 1 year after the therapy. Additionally, the par-
ticipants were called on the telephone before the start of the
therapy, and 3–6 months and 11 months after the intensive
therapy. Raw results are presented as the medians, quartiles,
means, and standard deviations in Table 3, but again these
values do not account for correlation and group effects and
must be interpreted with due care. Although the values for

stuttering frequency and the mean of the longest stuttering
events were not normally distributed, we have calculated
means and standard deviations in addition to median and
quartiles to allow for comparisons as this has also been
done in most previous publications.

For the stuttering rate, older participants were estimated
to present slightly more severe problems than younger ones
(þ0.0034, SE 0.0191, p value, .86) and females slightly less
severe problems than males (–0.0024, SE 0.0195, p value
.90). With adjustment for age and gender, the amelioration
between the diagnostic stage 2–6 months before therapy and
12 months after the intensive therapy proved to be statistic-
ally significant (Interview: –0.08, SE 0.01, Reading: –0.12, SE
0.01, Telephone: –0.08, SE 0.01, p < .001).

The difference in the mean length of the three longest
stuttering events, adjusted for age and gender, was statistic-
ally significant (Interview: –1.12, SE 0.46, Reading: –1.95, SE

The effect is measured as the mean difference between 12-month post-treat-
ment and prior treatment (value before treatment minus value 12-month
post-treatment) separately for the types of measurement per endpoint and
adjusted for age group and gender. This is listed under “Estimate.” The corre-
sponding standard error of the estimate is given under “Std. Error.” The mar-
ginal p value is obtained using a likelihood-ratio test comparing a model with
consideration of the effect of the last time point versus a model without con-
sideration of the effect of the last time point and is calculated marginal over
the types of measurement.

0.47, Telephone: –1.31, SE 0.51, p < .001). We observed on
average longer stutter events for females (þ0.688, SE 0.492,
p value .168) and shorter stutter events for older people
(–0.271, SE 0.484, p value .58).

Effect estimates for the difference 12 months post-treat-
ment to prior treatment, adjusted for age group and gender,
using the information of all time points with a mixed model
are listed in Table 4. Here, the estimated mean difference is
evident. For the FzS, the raw value is 36 points lower. For
the stuttering rate, the effect was 0.084 for the interview and
the telephone call and 0.122 for text reading.

Speech naturalness

The results for distracting sounds, facial grimaces, and head
movements in the videos the interviews were judged on a
scale from 0 (normal) to 5 (markedly deviant). Additionally,
data on three perceptive parameters (prosody, breathing,
and tonus) are reported here (classified 0–2). For these data,
no statistical calculations were done and the results are pre-
sented only descriptively. The values need to be interpreted
with due care as the intra-patient correlations and group
effects were ignored.

Figure 1 shows the development of distracting sounds,
facial grimaces, and head movements. Distracting sounds
apparently improved from the beginning of the therapy to
the end of the therapy and had even improved over the
period of 1 year after the therapy. Here the number of
patients who were classified as normal (0) or not noticeable
unless looking for it (1) increased.

Figure 2 shows the classification for prosody, breathing,
and tonus for all assessment points. Prosody seemed to wor-
sen from the beginning of the therapy to the end of the
therapy; 1 year later it resembled the status before therapy.
Tone and breathing seemed to worsen from the beginning
of the therapy to the end of the therapy; after 1 year both
parameters were judged as improved compared to before
the therapy.

Our data present evidence for the efficacy of the investigated
therapy in that we found significant improvement of the
symptoms, evident in reduction of the stuttering rate, and
an amelioration of general quality of life (SDQ) and psycho-
social self-esteem of a person who stutters (FzS).

The patients accepted at the treatment centre were older
children, adolescents, and young adults with severe stutter-
ing, in other words those with a persisting stuttering. Nearly
all of them had undergone stuttering treatment before with-
out long-lasting effect. Patients and their relatives therefore
suffered from a severe communication disorder and were
willing to invest time and energy in the therapy. Several ear-
lier studies have shown that an intensive treatment of stut-
tering is more effective compared to a therapy with low
intensity [3].

The present trial investigated the fluency shaping stutter-
ing therapy as developed by Sch€utz [47]. Stuttering rate was
the comparison
shown to be reduced significantly for
between before and 1 year after the intensive treatment.
Although the effect was seen to be stronger at the end of
treatment compared to 12 months after treatment, the effect
was still significant after 12 months and the decrease of the
effect is moderate. The same was the case for the three most
extended stuttering events.

In addition, we also looked at the quality of life as meas-
ured with the SDQ completed by participants and their
parents and the subjective assessment of stuttering by the
participants themselves in the speech questionnaire, both of
which demonstrated significant improvement.

We examined all patients who were willing to participate
in the therapy. None of the patients who were treated in the
centre between 1 January 2014 and 28 February 2015
declined to participate in the study. For this reason, we had
a broad range of age. The FzS and the SDQ are question-
naires developed for subjects under 18 and 17 years, respect-
ively
conducted the
calculations adjusted for subjects <17 years and above and
for males and females. Older subjects and both genders
reacted to the therapy in a comparable way (sensitivity ana-
lysis, results not shown), but we observed that older subjects
complained on average of a more severe handicap and the
SDQ demonstrated more
symptoms.
However, we observed a relatively high p value and thus it
cannot be ruled out that the effect was observed by chance.

As in most other studies about stuttering, we included
substantially more male participants. Interestingly, male par-
ticipants <17 years reported on average less subjective
impact of the stuttering but they demonstrated more severe
stuttering symptoms compared to female participants. Here,
the observed p values indicate a statistically notable effect.

As this analysis was solely performed exploratively,
needs to be validated in a separate study.

Euler and his group [56] conducted a retrospective evalu-
ation of stuttering treatment by the clients themselves.
Clients judged two methods (stuttering modification and
fluency shaping) as effective and three methods (breathing
treatment, hypnosis, and unspecific logopedic treatment) as

ineffective. Stuttering modification and fluency shaping were
perceived as equally effective. Further analysis of the data
showed that group treatment was generally superior to indi-
vidual treatment [56]. The authors also stressed the intensity

of treatment and advocated at least periods of
intensive
treatment, something which contrasts strongly with com-
mon treatment approaches in Germany. Most patients nom-
inally receive a single session per week, in reality less due to

holidays and illness on the part of either patient or therap-
ist. Relevant characteristics of treatment such as the use of
fluency shaping techniques, the intensive character of ther-
apy over weeks, and the interval character are realised both
in the Kasseler Stutter Therapy [45] and in the therapy

studied here [47]. Euler et al. [45] reported on about 400
clients and followed 69 of
them for more than 1 year.
Disfluency rates collected in four different speech situations
were reduced from 12.6% SS before therapy to 1.6% after
therapy and remained in the following 3 years between 3.2

and 3.8% SS in those who could be examined. Subjective
stuttering data (self-rating of stuttering severity and of
avoidance of speech or speech situations) reflected the same
trends, but to a lesser extent.

In contrast to other long-term outcome studies, we were
able to collect almost complete data. The original sample
consisted of 56 participants who could afford the costs of
the treatment, either by themselves or with the support of
their health insurance company, and who were assessed at
the treatment centre as suffering from psychological strain
due to severe stuttering. In total, 53 of these participants fol-
lowed the complete therapy programme and we were able
to collect all data including examination 1 year after the
completion of the intensive therapy. We collected 601 out of
a possible 616 samples; 2.4% were missing. We had no miss-
ing data for the SDQ, all patients and all relatives answered
both times, nor for the FzS, as all participants gave back
two questionnaires before
therapy and two after
the therapy.

the

Bloodstein and Bernstein-Ratner [34] proposed 12 crite-
ria to judge stuttering treatment. With the present investiga-
tion, most of
these criteria are fulfilled. We present
prospective data including objective measurements and data
on self-evaluation of quality of life in a repeated-measures
design through to 1 year after treatment. We did not fulfil
the sixth criterion because of the lack of a control group,
but the repeated measurements before the start of the inten-
sive treatment demonstrate a relatively constant symptom-
atology. Another limitation (criterion 11 in Bloodstein and
Bernstein-Ratner) is the fact that the described therapy has
so far only been practised by the developer and her daugh-
ter. They plan to teach her method to other speech–lan-
guage pathologists in which case future studies will be able
to evaluate the efficiency of this method when applied by
other therapists.

Conclusions

In our study, we found that the therapy studied was associ-
ated with an improvement of the relevant endpoints quality
of life, impact of stuttering, and severity of stuttering. We
found the most relevant effect sizes for impact of stuttering
on life quality, but also for the stuttering rate and mean
length of the three longest stuttering events in the interview.
