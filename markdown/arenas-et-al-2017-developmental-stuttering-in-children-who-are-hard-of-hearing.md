Developmental Stuttering in Children
Who Are Hard of Hearing

Richard M. Arenas,a Elizabeth A. Walker,b and Jacob J. Olesonc

Purpose: A number of studies with large sample sizes have
reported lower prevalence of stuttering in children with
significant hearing loss compared to children without hearing
loss. This study used a parent questionnaire to investigate
the characteristics of stuttering (e.g., incidence, prevalence,
and age of onset) in children who are hard of hearing (CHH).
Method: Three hundred three parents of CHH who
participated in the Outcomes of Children With Hearing
Loss study (Moeller & Tomblin, 2015) were sent questionnaires
asking about their child’s history of stuttering.
Results: One hundred ninety-four parents of CHH
responded to the survey. Thirty-three CHH were reported
to have stuttered at one point in time (an incidence of
17.01%), and 10 children were still stuttering at the time
of survey submission (a prevalence of 5.15%). Compared

to estimates in the general population, this sample
displayed a significantly higher incidence and prevalence.
The age of onset, recovery rate, and other characteristics
were similar to hearing children.
Conclusions: Based on this sample, mild to moderately
severe hearing loss does not appear to be a protective
factor for stuttering in the preschool years. In fact, the
incidence and prevalence of stuttering may be higher in
this population compared to the general population. Despite
the significant speech and language needs that children
with mild to moderately severe hearing loss may have,
speech-language pathologists should appropriately prioritize
stuttering treatment as they would in the hearing population.

S tuttering is a communication disorder characterized

by involuntary disruptions in the smooth forward
flow of speech. Fluency lies along a continuum in

which one end represents completely smooth forward flow-
ing speech and the other end characterizes speech that is
not moving forward at all. It is not uncommon for all
speakers, especially young children whose speech and lan-
guage skills are still developing, to occasionally exhibit
“normal” disfluencies like interjections, phrase repetitions,
or multisyllabic whole-word repetitions. However, most
speakers rarely have “stuttering-like disfluencies” in the
form of sound or syllable repetitions, audible or inaudible
sound prolongations, or monosyllabic whole-word repeti-
tions (Ambrose & Yairi, 1999). When a person exhibits
a high percentage of stuttering-like disfluencies, typically

3% of syllables, they are classified as a person who stutters.
This criterion has recently been questioned for multilingual
speakers, as Byrd, Bedore, and Ramos (2015) found that
bilingual speakers who do not stutter exhibit higher levels
of stuttering-like disfluencies (with the exception of pro-
longations) than monolingual children who do not stutter.
Developmental stuttering is a term used to describe stutter-
ing behavior that first emerges in the early childhood years,
typically following a time when the child was previously
speaking fluently (meaning very few or no stuttering-like
disfluencies; Bloodstein & Ratner, 2008). In this article, we
describe a preliminary investigation of the incidence and
prevalence of developmental stuttering in young children
with mild to moderately severe hearing loss, from this point
on referred to as children who are hard of hearing (CHH).

have provided improved understanding of the characteris-
tics of developmental stuttering, including incidence and
prevalence, age of onset, and the rate of recovery or persis-
tence. Yairi and Ambrose (2013) synthesized the current
knowledge of the incidence and prevalence of stuttering in
a review where they noted that developmental stuttering
typically begins during the preschool years between the ages
of 2 and 4 years, with over 75% of children “outgrowing”
stuttering within 18 months of onset. The incidence of stut-
tering (i.e., the percentage of people who have ever exhib-
ited stuttering behavior in their lifetime) is between 5% and
8% of the general population. Prevalence of stuttering (i.e.,
the percentage of people who are currently exhibiting stut-
tering behavior) is estimated to be approximately 1%. Of
the 1% who are currently stuttering, the vast majority are
preschool aged, and most will not persist in stuttering into
adulthood (Yairi & Ambrose, 2013).

It is hypothesized that the onset and development

of stuttering is multifactorial, meaning that there are many
factors that likely contribute to this, including genetics,
speech, language, temperamental, and environmental fac-
tors (Conture & Walden, 2012; Smith & Weber, 2016). In
spite of the complex and dynamic interaction of factors
that contribute to stuttering, recent studies investigating
preschoolers who stutter close to the age of onset, especially
longitudinal studies, have identified potential speech and
language factors that may contribute to stuttering onset
and persistence. Although there is a great deal of hetero-
geneity in speech and language abilities of children who
stutter, general trends are also observed. For example, a
meta-analysis of overall language abilities found that chil-
dren who stutter scored significantly lower on standardized
tests of overall language measures (including separate
receptive and expressive scores), as well as mean length of
utterance, compared to typically fluent children (Ntourou,
Conture, & Lipsey, 2011). There is substantial evidence
that preschoolers who stutter have a higher prevalence of
phonological or articulation disorders (Arndt & Healey,
2001; Blood, Ridenour, & Qualls, 2003; Blood & Seider,
1981; Wolk, Edwards, & Conture, 1993). Longitudinal
studies have shown that, close to the onset of stuttering,
children who persist show poorer phonological and artic-
ulation abilities (Paden, Ambrose, & Yairi, 2002; Spencer
& Weber-Fox, 2014) as well as nonword repetition perfor-
mance (Spencer & Weber-Fox, 2014) compared to children
who recover from stuttering. However, no single variable
provides predictive ability to differentiate at the individual
level that children will or will not recover from stuttering.
At present, the data suggest that these factors should be
viewed as potential risk factors and should be weighed
together with other potential factors like language disso-
ciations (Anderson, Pellowski, & Conture, 2005; Clark,
Conture, Walden, & Lambert, 2015; Coulter, Anderson,
& Conture, 2009), family history of stuttering (Kraft &
Yairi, 2012), and the goodness of fit between temperament
and environmental contexts (Ambrose et al., 2015; Jones,
Choi, Conture, & Walden, 2014).

Relationship Between Stuttering and Audition

Many phenomena that tend to reduce the frequency

of stuttering involve changes in audition. For example,
delayed auditory feedback, frequency shifted feedback,
shadowing another person’s speech, and noise that blocks
the speaker from hearing his or her own voice temporarily
increase fluency in some, but not all, persons who stutter
(Bloodstein & Ratner, 2008). The mechanisms that under-
lie improved fluency with altered audition are not fully
understood, but some have hypothesized that people who
stutter rely too heavily on sensory feedback during speech
production (Hutchinson & Ringel, 1975; Tourville, Reilly,
& Guenther, 2008; van Lieshout, Peters, Starkweather, &
Hulstijn, 1993). Civier, Tasko, and Guenther (2010) used
the Directions Into Velocities of Articulators neural network
model to demonstrate how an increased reliance on auditory
feedback could result in disfluent behavior, specifically
repetitions. Most pertinent to this study is that the feedback-
biased model produced less disfluencies during simulations
with auditory masking, with a greater reduction in stuttering
when the masking was louder. It was hypothesized that
masking increases fluency because it increases the signal-
to-noise ratio, making it less likely that errors will be detected
between the intended and actual speech signal. They further
hypothesized that “Hearing loss and whispering are addi-
tional conditions that affect the intensity (as well as quality)
of auditory feedback, and according to the current account,
should improve fluency as well. Indeed, the incidence of
stuttering, in children who are deaf or hard of hearing, is
low, and especially so in the completely deaf” (p. 265). This
model highlights why it may be theoretically important to
investigate the relationship between stuttering and the de-
gree of hearing loss. It may be that significant hearing loss
does indeed reduce the prevalence of stuttering (Backus,
1938; Harms & Malone, 1939; Montgomery & Fitch, 1988),
but more data are needed regarding stuttering in CHH to
determine the relationship between audition and stuttering
across the spectrum of hearing loss. Investigating CHH may
provide further insight into the association between audition
and stuttering and further refinement of current theoretical
models.

Developmental Stuttering in Children
With Hearing Loss

Across individuals from diverse backgrounds (e.g.,
race and cultures), similar incidence and prevalence rates
of stuttering have been found (Bloodstein & Ratner, 2008).
One exception is the low prevalence of stuttering that has
been reported in children with hearing loss. Three studies
using teacher surveys sent to schools for the deaf/hard of
hearing found extremely low occurrences of stuttering from
significant sample sizes (Backus, 1938; Harms & Malone,
1939; Montgomery & Fitch, 1988). Two early studies had
a combined sample of 28,000 students from “schools for
the deaf,” and there was a report of only 14 children who
stuttered, a prevalence of about 0.05% (Backus, 1938; Harms

Arenas et al.: Stuttering in Hard of Hearing Children 235

Downloaded from: https://pubs.asha.org Michigan State University on 11/11/2025, Terms of Use: https://pubs.asha.org/pubs/rights_and_permissions & Malone, 1939). A more recent study used similar sur-
vey methodology from a sample of 9,930 children from
schools for the deaf/hard of hearing. Only 12 children
exhibited stuttering behavior, a prevalence of about 0.12%
(Montgomery & Fitch, 1988). It is important to note that
in this study three children stuttered in the oral mode,
six children stuttered in the manual mode, and three chil-
dren stuttered in both modes. Given that the prevalence
of stuttering in school-age children is estimated to be at
least 1% (Yairi & Ambrose, 2013), the low prevalence
reports in children with hearing loss are quite striking.

Despite large sample sizes, the three studies that inves-

tigated stuttering in the deaf/hard of hearing population
are limited in several ways. First, the studies used teacher
surveys that asked about children’s stuttering during the
school-age years, a period when most children have recov-
ered from stuttering. The teachers likely would not have
had knowledge of the children’s stuttering during the pre-
school years when stuttering is more prevalent. A similar
survey study would be better aimed at parents who had first-
hand experience with the child during the preschool years.
Second, two of the studies were not specific in reporting the
degree of hearing loss of the sampled children (Backus, 1938;
Harms & Malone, 1939). Given that most of the children
were enrolled in a self-contained school for the deaf or hard
of hearing, we may conclude that the participants had severe
to profound hearing loss, and children with mild to severe
hearing loss were underrepresented. CHH are typically edu-
cated in the regular education setting (Karchmer, Mitchell,
Marschark, & Spencer, 2003). Third, the studies did not
collect speech or language data to help identify how these
factors may have been related to stuttering in this population.

Speech and Language Abilities of Children With
Mild to Moderate Hearing Loss

CHH are a historically underserved and underresearched
population (Donahue, 2007). The lack of research has resulted
in limited knowledge regarding developmental outcomes
and susceptibility to a range of communication disorders
in CHH (Eisenberg et al., 2007). This gap in the research
literature has been rectified in recent years, with the imple-
mentation of several longitudinal research studies (Ching
et al., 2013; Holte et al., 2012; Stika et al., 2015). The Out-
comes of Children With Hearing Loss (OCHL) project is
one of these multicenter, longitudinal studies. The goal
of the project was to obtain a clearer understanding of the
speech, language, and auditory outcomes of CHH who rely
on spoken English in the absence of additional disabilities
(Moeller & Tomblin, 2015). Recent evidence from the OCHL
team indicates that hearing loss in the mild to moderately
severe range (i.e., 25–75 dB HL) places these children at
risk for speech and language delays compared to their peers
with typical hearing (Tomblin, Harrison, Ambrose, Oleson,
& Moeller, 2015). These delays are most evident in the
domain of morphosyntax, although vocabulary and articu-
lation skills are also depressed during the preschool years.
Auditory access, through the consistent use of early, well-fit

hearing aids, appears to mitigate the challenges of hear-
ing loss for this population (Moeller, Tomblin, & OCHL
Collaboration, 2015). Despite the recent emergence of
longitudinal studies of CHH to investigate speech and lan-
guage outcomes, to our knowledge there has not been a
systematic investigation of stuttering in this population to
compare to previous studies that investigated stuttering in
populations with more severe hearing losses.

Purpose of the Study

The unanswered questions regarding stuttering in
CHH are important given the predominant view that stut-
tering is less prevalent in people with hearing loss (Andrews
et al., 1983; Montgomery & Fitch, 1988). A better under-
standing of how hearing loss relates to stuttering is impor-
tant both theoretically (e.g., the role of auditory feedback
in stuttering) and clinically (e.g., informing clinicians who
work with CHH). This study examines characteristics of
stuttering in CHH via parent reports during the preschool
years. If stuttering behaviors were reported, parents pro-
vided information about stuttering onset, at what age the
child stopped stuttering (if they had stopped), characteris-
tics of the stuttering, and whether the child had ever been
treated for stuttering. Longitudinal data from the OCHL
study (Tomblin, Walker, et al., 2015) allowed for investiga-
tion of the relationship between stuttering and speech, lan-
guage, and hearing variables. Our research questions are
indicated below.

1. What is the incidence and prevalence of stuttering

in CHH?

2. What are the characteristics of stuttering in CHH
(e.g., age of onset and types of disfluencies)?

3.

In CHH, around the average age of stuttering onset,
are there differences in the speech, language, or
hearing abilities between children with and without
a history of stuttering, and are there differences
between children who recovered from stuttering
versus those who are at risk of persisting?

Method
Participants

Participants were parents of CHH who were recruited

to participate in the OCHL longitudinal study (Tomblin,
Walker, et al., 2015). Children with a confirmed sensori-
neural, mixed, or permanent conductive bilateral hearing
loss between 25 and 75 dB HL were included. All had at least
one parent or primary caregiver who spoke English in the
home. Children with developmental disabilities in addition
to hearing loss were not included. Families were recruited
from three study sites and surrounding states: University
of Iowa, Iowa City; Boys Town National Research Hospi-
tal, Omaha, Nebraska; and University of North Carolina,
Chapel Hill. For the OCHL study, approval was obtained
from the institutional review board at each research center.

was obtained from the University of Iowa.

Requests were sent to 303 parents of children in the

OCHL study to respond to a fluency survey to obtain infor-
mation about their children’s history of stuttering. Two
hundred and seventy-five of the requests were e-mailed to
the parents with a link to an online version of the survey
and a unique identifying number that tied their response to
their child’s OCHL data. E-mail addresses were not available
for 28 of the parents, so a paper copy of the survey was sent
to their home address with a postage-paid return envelope.
There were 194 responses to the survey, 181 online responses
and 13 paper copies, for a return rate of 64%. The 13 hard
copy surveys that were mailed in were entered into the online
survey system by two different research assistants to ensure
reliable transfer of data. Survey responses were received in
the spring and summer of 2015. Respondents were not com-
pensated for their participation in the survey, but the high
return rate is likely related to the brief nature of the survey
and the long-standing relationship the parents had with the
OCHL research team.

Selected demographic data from the parents and

hearing measures of the children from the OCHL study
were used to test for bias created by those that responded
(respondents) to the survey compared to those who did
not respond (nonrespondents). There was no significant dif-
ference between respondents and nonrespondents with regard
to the children’s better ear pure-tone average (BEPTA),
age at which the child was fitted with a hearing aid, age
of the child at the time of survey request, or the mother’s
age. Table 1 provides a summary of these comparisons.
Additional analyses using chi-square tests compared
respondents to nonrespondents by mother’s education
and income level. Mother’s education was converted to
four levels, which were (a) high school or less, (b) post-
secondary education, (c) college graduate, and (d) post-
graduate work. Income levels were converted to six levels,
which were (1) < $20,000, (2) $20,001–$40,000, (3) $40,001–
$60,000, (4) $60,001–$80,000, (5) $80,000–$100,000, and
(6) > $100,000. There was a statistically significant differ-
ence in mother’s education level ( p = .0004) and income
level ( p = .0162) between respondents and nonrespondents.
Table 2 shows that the nonrespondent group tended to
have lower levels of maternal education and income com-
pared to the respondents.

It is important to note that all but five of the children

who had a survey returned were fitted with hearing aids.
Those that were not fitted had mild hearing loss. There
were also eight children who were implanted with cochlear
implants over the course of the OCHL longitudinal study.
All eight of these children were previously fitted with hearing
aids.

Fluency Survey

The primary purpose of the fluency survey was to

gather information from parents about their children’s his-
tory of stuttering. The survey targeted parents because they
likely had the most consistent exposure to the child during
the preschool years when stuttering is most prevalent. If the
parents indicated that their child had exhibited stuttering
behaviors at one point in time, they were asked a series of
questions regarding the nature of the stuttering behavior,
the age of stuttering onset, age when the stuttering stopped
(if it had), and whether the child ever received therapy for
stuttering.

cies (interjections, revisions, and phrase repetitions) and
stuttering-like disfluencies (monosyllabic whole-word
repetitions, sound or syllable repetitions, and blocks or pro-
longations) may not be known to most parents, so a descrip-
tion of these behaviors and the distinction between typical
and stuttering-like disfluencies were explicitly provided at
the beginning of the survey. Although monosyllabic whole-
word repetitions (e.g., I-I-I-I like cookies.) are typically con-
sidered to be stuttering-like disfluencies (Ambrose & Yairi,
1999) and are a common characteristic of preschool stutter-
ing, we did not include these in the definition of stuttering
provided to the parents because we did not want to confuse
parents with the distinction between monosyllabic whole-
word repetitions (which are considered stuttering-like repe-
titions) and multisyllabic whole-word repetitions (which
are considered typical disfluencies). Brocklehurst (2013)
argued that incidence and prevalence studies may produce
inflated rates because of how stuttering is defined, in partic-
ular because of the inclusion of monosyllabic whole-word
repetitions. Yairi (2013) strongly defended the inclusion
of monosyllabic whole-word repetitions in the definition
of stuttering, a viewpoint that we agree with. However,
due to the survey’s retrospective reporting of stuttering, the
decision not to include whole-word repetitions in the stut-
tering definition aimed to reduce reports of stuttering that
were possibly questionable. The Appendix includes the sur-
vey questions. The online and paper copy of the fluency
survey had identical questions.

Speech, Language, and Hearing Data

Speech, language, and hearing data were collected
annually from children during their participation in the
OCHL longitudinal study (see Tomblin, Walker, et al.,
2015, for a full description of the study design, protocols,
and outcome measures). The OCHL study used an acceler-
ated longitudinal design in which children were recruited
at various ages from birth to 7 years and followed for at
least 3 years. Due to the staggered age of initial participa-
tion in the study, not all children have data at all ages, and
different speech and language measures were collected at
each age. However, hearing data were gathered for all chil-
dren at all visits. The two hearing measures used for group
comparisons were BEPTA and aided speech intelligibility
index (SII; American National Standards Institute, 1997).
BEPTA is a means for describing the degree of hearing
loss; it was calculated by taking the average of unaided
hearing thresholds for pure-tone stimuli at three or four fre-
quencies in the better ear. BEPTA of less than 20 dB HL
represents hearing within normal limits; BEPTA between
20 and 40 dB HL represents mild hearing loss; BEPTA
between 41 and 60 dB HL represents moderate hearing loss;
and BEPTA between 61 and 80 dB HL represents severe
hearing loss. Rather than describing access to sound in
terms of unaided thresholds to pure-tone stimuli, aided audi-
bility, quantified by the SII, was used. Aided SII is a means
for describing the percentage of the long-term average

speech spectrum that is accessible with hearing aids at a
given input level. SII is measured on a scale of 0–1, with
0 representing no access to the speech spectrum and 1 rep-
resenting full access to the speech spectrum. It more accu-
rately represents the everyday listening experiences of
CHH than unaided pure-tone average. It can be used to
account for amplification characteristics of hearing aids,
including proximity of hearing aid fit to prescriptive targets
(McCreery et al., 2015), variability in ear canal acoustics,
and amount of access to the speech spectrum at a conver-
sational level (Stiles, Bentler, & McGregor, 2012).

Speech and language analyses in this study focused
on the 3- and 4-year visits to compare speech, language,
and hearing data at the ages when stuttering tends to first
emerge (the average age of stuttering onset in this sample
was 3.71 years old). The 3-year speech and language data
consisted of the standard scores from the Goldman-Fristoe
Test of Articulation–Second Edition (GFTA-2; Goldman &
Fristoe, 2000), Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales–Second
Edition (Vineland-II; Sparrow et al., 2005) composite
scores, the Comprehensive Assessment of Spoken Lan-
guage (CASL; Carrow-Woolfolk, 1999) composite score,
and scaled scores from subtests of the MacArthur–Bates
Communicative Development Inventory Upper Extension
(MBCDI; Fenson et al., 1993). The 4-year speech and
language data consisted of the standard scores from the
Vineland and CASL composite scores, Test of Preschool
Early Literacy (TOPEL; Lonigan, Wagner, Torgesen, &
Rashotte, 2007) phonological awareness subtest, scaled
scores from selected Vineland-II subtests, and the Wechsler
Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence–Third Edition
( WPPSI-III; Wechsler, 2002) vocabulary subtest.

Data Analysis

Most of the data from the survey were categorical.

Exact binomial tests were conducted on the incidence and
prevalence data to compare our sample to the theoretically
expected distribution obtained from population estimates
in the literature. The exact binomial test is used to test the
null hypothesis that two categories are equally likely to
occur and does not rely on an asymptotic normality assump-
tion. To relate continuous variables such as age of stuttering
onset and speech, language, and hearing variables from
OCHL to stuttering status, we used two-sample t tests with
a Satterthwaite adjustment for unequal variances. In addi-
tion, we used a stepwise selection procedure with logistic
regression to determine which of the variables were the most
important in determining stuttering status. Specifically, the
outcome variables in the models were children who have
exhibited stuttering versus those who never stuttered, and
children who were still stuttering at the time of survey
submission compared to children who had stopped stut-
tering. All significance tests were evaluated at the standard
.05 level of significance. Due to the exploratory nature
of this study, no alpha adjustments were made for multi-
ple tests. Where appropriate, Cohen’s d effect sizes are
reported. Analyses were carried out in SPSS (Version 23;

to the fluency survey are presented in Table 3. The individ-
ual responses to the survey from those who stated that
their child had stuttered at one point in time are provided
in the Supplemental Material.

Research Question 1: What is the Incidence
and Prevalence of Stuttering in CHH?

From the 194 surveys returned, 33 children were

identified as having exhibited stuttering behaviors at some
point in their life, resulting in an incidence of 17.01%. An
exact binomial test comparing the incidence from this sample
to an estimated incidence of 8% in the general population
(Yairi & Ambrose, 2013) yielded a significant difference
(p < .0001, 95% CI [0.120, 0.231]). Ten children were stutter-
ing at the time of survey submission, corresponding with a
prevalence of 5.15%. An exact binomial test, comparing
the prevalence from this sample to an estimated prevalence
of 1.5% in the general population in the age group of most
of the children who were surveyed, yielded a significant
difference ( p = .0008, 95% CI [0.025, 0.093]). The 1.5%
estimated prevalence used for this analysis is a conservative
estimate for school-age children based on the synthesis of
prevalence studies from Yairi and Ambrose (2013).

Research Question 2: What Are the
Characteristics of Stuttering in CHH?
Age of Onset

The average age of stuttering onset for all the chil-

dren who were reported to have stuttered was 3.7 years
(SD = 1.4). The average age of onset for the children who
had stopped stuttering (from this point on, to be referred
to as recovered) was 3.2 years (SD = 1.1). The average age
of onset for the children who were still stuttering at the
time of survey submission was 4.8 years (SD = 1.7). A
two-sample t test, with a Satterthwaite adjustment for
unequal group variance, showed a significant difference
in the age of onset of those who have recovered and those
who were still stuttering at the time of the survey ( p = .02).

Age of Recovery and Length of Time
Stuttering Before Recovery

For the children who recovered, the average age at
which they stopped stuttering was 4.59 years (SD = 1.16).
However, the average age of recovery was based on 16 chil-
dren, because data were not provided about the age stuttering
stopped for seven of the 23 children who recovered. The aver-
age length of time stuttering before recovery was calculated
by subtracting the age when stuttering stopped from the age
of onset, which yielded an average of 1.52 years (SD = 1.33).

Types of Disfluencies

Written descriptions of the types of stuttering that

the child exhibited were provided by the survey respondents
for all of the children who had stuttered. These descriptions
are presented in the Supplemental Material. The descriptions

stuttering behaviors were described at the beginning of the
fluency survey (repetitions, prolongations, and blocks).
Table 4 shows the frequency counts for each type of dis-
fluency that was described, as well as mutually exclusive
categories of the manner in which the children stuttered.
Repetitions were the most common type of stuttering, with
72.7% of children demonstrating this type of disfluency.
These repetitions should be interpreted to be sound or sylla-
ble repetitions given that the description of disfluencies at
the beginning of the survey explicitly stated that whole-word
repetitions were not stuttering-like behaviors. As stated
before, we are not stating that monosyllabic whole-word
repetitions are not stuttering-like disfluencies; however,
to be conservative, we decided not to include whole-word
repetitions in this study. Prolongations were the next most
common type of disfluency (39.4%), followed by blocks
(27.3%).

Mutually exclusive categories of stuttering descrip-
tions showed that close to half of the children only exhib-
ited repetitions (42.4%), with a much smaller percentage
only exhibiting prolongations (21.2%) or only blocks (6.1%).
The rest of the children had repetitions and some combina-
tion of other stuttering-like disfluencies.

Secondary Behaviors

Nine of the children were reported to display only

secondary behaviors. Four responses described the secondary
behaviors, which are provided in the Supplemental Material.
Some examples of secondary behaviors are “failure to make
eye contact,” “shows signs of tensing up and straining,”
and “eye blinking, sniffing.”

Avoidance Behaviors

Eleven children showed avoidance behaviors. Three

children had both secondary behaviors and avoidance
behaviors. Eight survey responses described the avoid-
ance behaviors, which are included in the Supplemental
Material. The most common theme regarding avoidance
was choosing not to speak or avoiding social situations
(e.g., “she will choose not to talk and instead try to avoid

finishing the sentence or statement or say never mind” and
“avoiding socializing with kids”).

Treatment for Stuttering

Twelve of the children were reported to have received

therapy. Descriptions regarding the details of the therapy
are presented in the Supplemental Material. Several of the
descriptions were rather vague (e.g., “speech,” “speech ther-
apy,” “speech therapy birth to present,” and “he was already
receiving speech therapy, stuttering only lasted couple of
weeks and stopped”), making it difficult to know whether
they were indicating that the child had received speech
therapy in general or whether therapy specifically targeted
stuttering. Of the 10 children who were still stuttering at the
time of the survey, four were indicated to have received
therapy for stuttering, but descriptions were unclear whether
therapy was currently occurring and whether the therapy
specifically targeted stuttering. One of the therapy descrip-
tions for a child who was still stuttering indicated “they
are aware of it at speech, but are choosing not to treat it
at this time.”

Research Question 3: In CHH, Around the Average
Age of Stuttering Onset, Are There Differences in
the Speech, Language, or Hearing Abilities Between
Children With and Without a History of Stuttering,
and Are There Differences Between Children Who
Recovered From Stuttering Versus Those Who
Are at Risk of Persisting?
CHH Who Stuttered Versus Those Who Never Stuttered
Speech, language, and hearing data obtained from
the OCHL dataset were used to compare children who
were reported to have stuttered to children who never stut-
tered. Table 5 shows descriptive data for each variable
using the 3- and 4-year OCHL data. For audiological mea-
sures, no significant difference was found in BEPTA, but
there was a significant difference in SII where children who
never stuttered had lower audibility (M = 0.81, SD = 0.10,
for children who stuttered; M = 0.76, SD = 0.14, for chil-
dren who never stuttered; p = .032, d = 0.411). In the 3-year
comparison, all of the speech and language variables except
MBCDI vocabulary, Vineland receptive, and CASL com-
posite were significant at the .05 level. Several variables
had medium effect sizes: GFTA (d = 0.595), MBCDI lan-
guage (d = 0.702), Vineland expressive language (d = 0.638),
Vineland socialization composite (d = 0.530), Vineland
motor composite (d = 0.659), and Vineland adaptive behav-
ior composite (d = 0.751). The MBCDI sentence had a large
effect size (d = 0.811). We know that many of these vari-
ables are highly correlated with each other, so we used
a stepwise logistic regression analysis to determine which
variables contribute the most unique information toward
stuttering status. Due to missing data at the 3-year visit
for some of the children, the logistic regression at this
age included 14 children who had stuttered and 40 who
never stuttered. In the stepwise logistic regression, Vineland

expressive was entered into the model as the most significant
variable ( p < .01), and SII was entered second ( p = .04).
None of the other variables were added, indicating that they
did not add significant information into the model that was
not already captured by Vineland expressive or SII. Results
indicate that the odds of not stuttering was 2.07 times higher
for a 1-unit higher Vineland expressive score. The logistic
regression analysis with the 4-year data included 17 who
stuttered and 61 who never stuttered. No variable reached
statistical significance.

CHH Who Recovered From Stuttering Versus
Those Who Are at Risk of Persisting

This analysis is particularly exploratory given that

there is a high likelihood that some of the children who
were still stuttering at the time the survey was submitted
will end up recovering. This was especially true for two of
the children who had been stuttering for less than 2 years
and were under 6 years of age. To be more conservative,
children in the “at risk of persistence” group were included
only if they had been stuttering for more than 24 months
or they were over 8 years old. These were deemed to be
reasonable cutoff criteria given that the children needed
to either have a late onset of stuttering or a long history
of stuttering, both of which are risk factors for persistence
(Yairi & Ambrose, 2005). Using these criteria, there were
eight children who were at risk of persistence and had
OCHL outcome data at either the 3- or 4-year visit. Speech,
language, and hearing data from the “at risk of persistence”

group were compared to the children who had stuttered at
one point but had recovered. A summary of the outcome
comparisons are presented in Table 6.

We conducted t tests to determine whether statistically

significant differences existed between groups. Medium or
greater effect sizes are reported. There was a significant dif-
ference and large effect size between age of onset between
the recovered (M = 3.2, SD = 1.1) and the “at risk of per-
sistence” group (M = 4.8, SD = 1.9, p = .05, d = 1.03).
There was also a statistically significant difference and large
effect size in TOPEL phonological awareness for recovered
(M = 94.2, SD = 19.8) versus still stuttering (M = 81.2,
SD = 7.2, p = .045, d = 0.875), with the recovered group
having higher scores. Although not statistically significant,
based on standard rules for assessing effect sizes (Sawilowsky,
2009), there was a medium effect size in better ear SII with
the recovered group (M = 0.82, SD = 0.11) having greater
audibility than the group who still stutter (M = 0.77, SD =
0.07, p = .169, d = 0.542). There was a medium effect size
difference on the MBCDI language composite at the 3-year
visit with children in the recovered group (M = 8.9, SD = 7.8),
outperforming children in the “at risk of persistence” group
(M = 5.8, SD = 2.0, p = .291, d = 0.534). There was also a
medium effect size difference on the CASL composite at the
3-year visit with children in the recovered group (M = 86.1,
SD = 16.9), outperforming children in the “at risk of persis-
tence” group (M = 77.7, SD = 14.0, p = .299, d = 0.541). A
similar trend in group comparison existed with a large effect
size difference on WPPSI-III vocabulary (M = 9.2, SD = 2.5,

the 4-year visit.

It is important to note that the only child reported to

have stuttered who also received cochlear implant is one
of the children in the “at risk of persistence” group. This
child was implanted at 2.12 years of age and began stuttering
at age 3; at the time of the survey, the child was 7.91 years
old. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a child with
a cochlear implant who seems likely to persist in stuttering.

Discussion

This study used a parent questionnaire to investigate
the characteristics of stuttering in CHH. The questionnaire
included information regarding age of stuttering onset,
age of recovery, types of disfluencies, secondary and avoid-
ance behaviors, and treatment of stuttering. Speech, hearing,
and language data from the OCHL study were used to
compare CHH who never stuttered to CHH who did stutter
at some point. We also compared children who were “at risk
of persistence” to children who recovered from stuttering.

Incidence and Prevalence

Both the incidence and prevalence of stuttering were

higher in this sample of CHH compared to estimates of
the general public. The incidence in this sample was 17.1%,
significantly greater than an estimated population incidence

of 8% (Yairi & Ambrose, 2013). The prevalence in this
sample was 5.15%, which was greater than an estimated
prevalence of 1.5% in the general population in the age
range of most of the children who were surveyed (Yairi &
Ambrose, 2013). These findings are important given the
previous research showing a lower prevalence of stuttering in
children with hearing loss (Backus, 1938; Harms & Malone,
1939; Montgomery & Fitch, 1988). There are several reasons
why our findings may contradict previous studies. First,
previous studies targeted school-age children so they would
not have detected children who recovered from stuttering.
Second, the earlier surveys were only sent to teachers in
schools for the deaf. These schools likely had a dispropor-
tionately high level of students with severe to profound
hearing loss, and there was little information regarding the
children’s use of speech versus sign. Third, the previous stud-
ies are relatively old, with two of the largest studies conducted
in the 1930s and a third study conducted in the mid-1980s.
The two oldest studies likely had children with limited access
to amplification due to late identification of hearing loss
and use of less sophisticated technologies than currently
available. Even in the 1980s, the sophistication and use of
hearing aids were limited compared to the recent advances
in technology and early identification. The higher incidence
and prevalence results in the current study were likely influ-
enced by the fact that we specifically targeted children who
had a mild to moderately severe hearing loss, they all com-
municated via spoken language, and most received hearing
aids at a relatively early age. Theoretical explanations for

later.

Characteristics of CHH Who Stutter and
Therapy Received

The characteristics of stuttering and its onset and

recovery in this sample of CHH are very similar to hearing
children who stutter. The age of onset (M = 3.7 years),
length of stuttering before recovery (M = 1.5 years), age
of recovery (M = 4.6 years), types of disfluencies, and
descriptions of secondary behaviors are all consistent with
what has been described in longitudinal studies of hearing
children who stutter (Yairi & Ambrose, 1999). The similarity
of these characteristics between CHH and hearing children
leads to the conclusion that early intervention of stuttering
should be introduced and administered in similar propor-
tions across both these populations.

Despite the high incidence of stuttering in this sample
of CHH and the reports of struggle and avoidance behaviors,
there was a striking lack of stuttering intervention provided
to these children. Of the 10 children who were still stuttering
at the time of the survey, four received therapy according
to parent report. All descriptions of therapy were rather
unspecific as to whether therapy was currently occurring
and whether the therapy specifically targeted stuttering.
For example, in one case a parent reported, “The hearing
impaired teacher in the More at Four program is working
with him.” In this case, it was not clear based on this descrip-
tion whether the teacher for the deaf/hard of hearing was
planning the stuttering therapy or whether they were imple-
menting strategies within the classroom to facilitate fluency
as instructed by a speech-language pathologist. One of the
therapy descriptions for a child who was still stuttering indi-
cated “they are aware of it at speech, but are choosing not
to treat it at this time.” This highlights some of the ambigu-
ity of the treatment descriptions: Either the child was receiv-
ing stuttering therapy previously but it was discontinued
or the parent’s “yes” response to stuttering therapy was
referring to speech therapy in general.

Given that most early intervention programs for

stuttering recommend some form of intervention (whether
direct or indirect) if stuttering has not begun to resolve
within 18 months, all of the eight children in the “at risk
of persistence” group should be receiving some form of
stuttering intervention. However, only one of those eight
indicated that they are receiving stuttering intervention.
The other seven children all exhibited, based on parents’
survey responses, well-established risk factors for persistence
based on their current age and length of time since stuttering
onset. Several of them also were reported to have second-
ary and/or avoidance behaviors and had descriptions like
“frustration, failure to make eye contact” and “she will
choose not to talk and instead try to avoid finishing the sen-
tence or statement or say never mind.” Due to the survey
nature of this study, it cannot be determined what role hear-
ing loss may be playing in avoidance behaviors. Perhaps the
most striking example where therapy seemed to be warranted

was with a child where therapy was described as “they are
aware of it at speech, but are choosing not to treat it at this
time.” At the time of the survey, this child was 8 years old
and had been stuttering since age 5, and the parent reported
“repetitions of the beginnings of a word, prolongations,
and blocks” and avoidance behaviors described as “tried to
avoid saying certain words.”

Differences Between CHH Who Have Never
Stuttered to Those Who Have Stuttered

Across a range of tests, children who never stuttered
displayed significantly greater speech and language skills at
3 years of age compared to children who stuttered at some
point. These results fit with findings from a meta-analysis,
which showed that there are subtle but significant differences
between the overall language abilities of hearing children
who stutter compared to those who do not stutter (Ntourou
et al., 2011). If language proficiency is a contributing factor for
stuttering onset (Conture & Walden, 2012; Smith & Weber,
2016), then the language delays seen in CHH (Tomblin,
Harrison, et al., 2015) may be contributing to the higher
incidence of stuttering in this sample. Furthermore, there
was a significant group difference in the 3-year Vineland
expressive, but not the Vineland receptive, demonstrating
a potential disassociation, something that has been hypoth-
esized to be a risk factor for stuttering (Anderson et al.,
2005; Clark et al., 2015; Coulter et al., 2009). However,
there were no significant differences in speech or language
measures at 4 years of age between children who never stut-
tered and children who stuttered. Given that the average
age of stuttering onset was 3.7 years, language delays or
disassociation between expressive and receptive language
may precede stuttering onset but dissipate shortly after.
There was also a significant difference, with a small effect
size, in aided SII: Children who stuttered at some point in
time had higher aided audibility than the CHH who never
stuttered. These results are discussed in more detail in the
next section.

Differences Between CHH Who Have
Recovered From Stuttering and Those
Who Are at Risk of Persistence

Exploratory analyses investigated variables that dif-

ferentiated CHH who recovered from stuttering (n = 20)
from CHH who were still stuttering at the time of the sur-
vey and who showed significance risk factors for persistence
(n = 8). There was a significant difference (with a large effect
size) between the groups on the TOPEL phonological
awareness at age 4. Phonological awareness is a measure
of a child’s understanding that speech is made up of abstract
units (e.g., syllables, onset and rime units, and individual
phonemes). This result is consistent with that of Paden,
Yairi, and Ambrose (1999), who found that children who
persisted in stuttering had poorer phonological abilities
compared to children who recovered from stuttering when
assessed close to stuttering onset. A second significant

was that the “at risk of persistence” group had a later aver-
age age of onset. This finding is consistent with longitudinal
studies, which showed that older age of onset is a risk factor
for persistence (Yairi & Ambrose, 2005). Due to the small
sample size in these analyses, there were several medium
to large effect size differences that did not reach statistical
significance. For example, there were medium effect sizes
where the recovered group outperformed the “at risk of per-
sistence” group on the MBCDI language composite and
the CASL composite and had higher SII scores. There was
also a similar group difference, but with a large effect size
on the WPPSI-III vocabulary. Collectively, between the dif-
ferences in age of onset, phonological awareness, and other
hearing and language variables with medium to large effect
sizes, the factors that may be related to persistent stuttering
in CHH are similar to variables that have been identified
as risk factors in hearing children (Ambrose, Yairi, Loucks,
Seery, & Throneburg, 2015; Paden et al., 2002; Yairi &
Ambrose, 2005; see Smith & Weber, 2016, for a synopsis
of the longitudinal work of the Purdue Stuttering Project).
It needs to be emphasized that these were exploratory
analyses with a small sample size, so further research is
warranted.

If indeed the recovered group has greater audibility

than the “at risk of persistence” group, as measured by
SII, it may have theoretical implications regarding the rela-
tionship between audibility and stuttering. SII is a means of
describing the percentage of the long-term average speech
spectrum that is accessible with hearing aids at a given in-
put level (e.g., 65 dB SPL or conversational speech). It more
accurately represents the everyday listening experiences of
CHH than unaided pure-tone average (McCreery et al.,
2015; Stiles et al., 2012). With the substantial evidence that
audition and auditory motor integration are involved in
fluency, poorer audibility could be a risk factor for persis-
tent stuttering. According to hypotheses of stuttering behav-
ior based on the Directions Into Velocities of Articulators
model, disfluencies occur when a sufficient degree of mis-
match between feedforward motor commands and percep-
tual feedback triggers a reset or a change in motor behavior
that is observed as stuttering (Civier et al., 2010; Max,
Guenther, Gracco, Ghosh, & Wallace, 2004). Although
explanations of stuttering using this model have mostly
implicated deficits in the feedforward system and an over-
reliance on feedback, it is also feasible that similar mis-
matches between feedforward and feedback could occur if
the auditory targets are less developed. Less defined audi-
tory targets may lead to less accurate auditory perception
and decreased feedforward stability, which could ultimately
lead to larger mismatches during speech production and an
increased risk of disfluencies.

Howell, Davis, and Williams (2006) showed that
hearing children who stutter have decreased auditory abili-
ties compared to hearing children who do not stutter, and
auditory abilities differentiate children who recovered from
stuttering from those who persisted. Howell, Rosen, Hannigan,
and Rustin (2000) demonstrated that a group of children

who stutter had poorer central auditory processing abilities,
as measured by backward masking thresholds, compared to
fluent age-matched children. The backward masking thresh-
olds were also correlated with stuttering severity. Howell
et al. (2006) found that backward masking thresholds were
significantly different between adolescents who stutter com-
pared to those who had recovered from stuttering. This
provides evidence that precise auditory perception may play
a role in fluent speech production. Lower audibility may
put children at greater risk of stuttering persistence due to
less quality auditory speech input that is necessary to develop
the integration of refined auditory targets in combination
with an adequate feedforward speech motor system. How-
ever, the children who stuttered in this study had greater
audibility than children who never stuttered, demonstrating
that audibility may be more related to persistence or recov-
ery and not stuttering onset.

Clinical Implications

The current study shows that the characteristics of

stuttering and potential risk factors for persistence may be
similar in CHH compared to hearing children. However,
on the basis of this sample, CHH may have a higher inci-
dence and prevalence of stuttering. Increased stuttering
may be related to the speech and language challenges that
CHH face. Despite the increased incidence of stuttering,
this study showed low degree of stuttering intervention in
CHH. This may be related to the fact that CHH often have
significant speech and language delays (Tomblin, Harrison,
et al., 2015) that are being addressed instead of the stuttering.
Given the psychosocial repercussions such as being bullied,
increased risk of social anxiety, decreased vocational oppor-
tunities, and decreased overall life satisfaction that are
associated with chronic stuttering (Blood, Blood, Maloney,
Meyer, & Qualls, 2007; Blumgart, Tran, & Craig, 2010),
it is important that speech-language pathologists are well
informed of the risks and negative outcomes of stuttering.
If in fact there is a lack of stuttering intervention in CHH,
as the current study suggests, there needs to be an education
campaign aimed at speech-language pathologists who com-
monly work with CHH to increase knowledge and clinical
preparedness to address stuttering.

Limitations and Future Directions

This investigation had several limitations. First, survey

data have inherent limitations compared to direct obser-
vations or interviews. For example, several descriptions
of stuttering treatment lacked clarity and specificity, making
it difficult to draw clear conclusions about the nature of
treatment received. Second, there was a limitation in the
retrospective nature of the survey and a lack of direct assess-
ment of stuttering behaviors. The average age of the children
at the time of survey submission was 7.4 years old, so the
parents were asked to remember speech patterns that may
have occurred several years in the past. It could be argued
that parent reports are not as reliable as direct observation

is strong agreement between parent reports and clinician
identification of stuttering (Curlee, 2007; Yairi & Ambrose,
2005). To address the potential limitations of retrospective
parental reports, the definition of stuttering behavior pro-
vided to the parents was limited to sound/syllable repetitions
and audible/inaudible prolongations, excluding monosyllabic
whole-word repetitions that most researchers categorize
as stuttering-like disfluencies (Yairi, 2013). This conserva-
tive definition may have actually biased the results toward
underreporting of stuttering. Third, only a subset of the
children had complete speech and language datasets from
the OCHL study, so the relationships between speech and
language factors and stuttering should be interpreted with
caution.

Future studies should further investigate the preva-

lence of stuttering in preschools that specialize in early inter-
vention and education for children with hearing loss to
allow for direct observation of stuttering behaviors in this
population. With the increased enrollment in early inter-
vention for CHH, a survey of school-based speech-language
pathologists would be important to understand the views
of stuttering in this population, as well as the likelihood
of stuttering intervention with CHH. It would also be bene-
ficial to develop best practice recommendations for how
to integrate stuttering intervention with the other speech/
language services that are most often provided to CHH.
Such recommendations would increase education of stutter-
ing for speech-language pathologists who focus on working
with children with hearing loss, hopefully leading to increased
stuttering intervention in this population.

Another possible future direction is investigating the
phenomena that influence stuttering frequency in children
with cochlear implants. Due to the nature of the technology,
this population may provide a unique opportunity to study
the role of audition in stuttering. For example, if a child stut-
ters and has a cochlear implant, it would be informative to
test what happens to their fluency if the implants were tem-
porarily turned off. Such a reduction in audition and hence
auditory feedback is difficult in hearing children without
high levels of masking. In the case of cochlear implants, it
may be possible to completely, or nearly completely, eliminate
auditory feedback without the use of masking, which itself
may introduce changes to the auditory motor integration
during speech.

Conclusion

The current results suggest that the incidence and
prevalence of stuttering in children with mild to moder-
ately severe hearing loss is as high, if not higher, than hear-
ing children. Given the delays in speech and language that
this population exhibits, reduced auditory access may put
these children at higher risk for both the emergence and
persistence of stuttering. Clinicians who work with CHH
should be aware of this potential increased risk and plan
interventions that address stuttering in addition to any
other communication needs.

Fluency Survey

We would like to ask you some questions about your child’s speech. These questions pertain to your child’s speech
right now, but also in the past, especially in the preschool years. We are interested in whether your child ever showed signs
of stuttering. Below are examples of what stuttering is and what stuttering is not.

Stuttering is a disruption in the forward flow of speech that can take the form of repetitions, prolongations, or blocking.

Below are examples of stuttered speech.
(cid:129)

Sound or syllable repetitions (e.g., ba-ba-ba-ball or foot-foot-football)
Prolonged sounds (e.g., s——ummer)

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

Silent blocks, typically at the beginning of words (e.g., ____hat)
Behaviors such as interjections (e.g., saying “um” or “like”) or repeating whole words or phrases are not considered
stuttering. Many children, especially during the preschool years, exhibit these types of behaviors, and they are not considered
stuttering.

1) At any point in time did your child show signs of stuttering behavior (like those described above)?

(A) No, my child never displayed stuttering-like behaviors.

(B) Yes, my child stuttered for a period of time but he/she no longer does.

(C) Yes, my child is currently showing signs of stuttering.

If you answered A to question 1) you are done with this questionnaire. If you answered B or C to question 1)

please continue.

2) Approximately what age did your child begin stuttering? ___________
3) What types of stuttering behaviors did you observe (e.g., repetitions, prolongation, blocks)?

________________________________________________________________

4) Did you notice any secondary behaviors (e.g., eye blinking, excessive tension) or avoidance behaviors (e.g., avoiding
certain words, sounds, or speaking situations)?

(A) Secondary behaviors

(B) Avoidance behaviors

(C) Both secondary behaviors and avoidance behaviors

(D) Neither types of behaviors

Please elaborate if you answered A, B, or C. _____________________________________

5) Did your child ever receive treatment/services for stuttering?

A) Yes
B) No
If yes, please state what type of services and for how long. _______________________

If your child no longer stutters, at what age did the stuttering stop? ___________
