The Impact of Social–Cognitive Stress on
Speech Variability, Determinism, and Stability
in Adults Who Do and Do Not Stutter

Purpose: This study examined the impact of social–cognitive
stress on sentence-level speech variability, determinism, and
stability in adults who stutter (AWS) and adults who do not
stutter (AWNS). We demonstrated that complementing the
spatiotemporal index (STI) with recurrence quantification
analysis (RQA) provides a novel approach to both assessing
and interpreting speech variability in stuttering.
Method: Twenty AWS and 21 AWNS repeated sentences
in audience and nonaudience conditions while their lip
movements were tracked. Across-sentence variability
was assessed via the STI; within-sentence determinism
and stability were assessed via RQA.
Results: Compared with the AWNS, the AWS produced
speech that was more variable across sentences and
more deterministic and stable within sentences. Audience

presence contributed to greater within-sentence
determinism and stability in the AWS. A subset of AWS
who were more susceptible to experiencing anxiety
exhibited reduced across-sentence variability in the
audience condition compared with the nonaudience
condition.
Conclusions: This study extends the assessment
of speech variability in AWS and AWNS into the
social–cognitive domain and demonstrates that the
characterization of speech within sentences using RQA
is complementary to the across-sentence STI measure.
AWS seem to adopt a more restrictive, less flexible
speaking approach in response to social–cognitive stress,
which is presumably a strategy for maintaining observably
fluent speech.

P ersistent developmental stuttering (herein referred

to simply as stuttering) is a communication disorder
thought to emerge from a complex interaction of

linguistic, cognitive, motor, and/or environmental processes
(Alm, 2014; Smith & Kelly, 1997; van Lieshout, Hulstijn,
& Peters, 2004; Zimmermann, 1980). Peripheral speech
behaviors associated with stuttering are intermittent and
range in expression from part-syllable repetitions and audible/

inaudible sound prolongations to inconsistencies during per-
ceptually fluent speech (e.g., increased kinematic variability,
reduced articulatory rate). Genetic predispositions may form
the basis for stuttering and stuttering behaviors in at least a
small subset of people who stutter (Kang et al., 2010; Raza
et al., 2016); however, the factors that underlie stuttering
within and across individuals are not well understood.

One approach to hypothesis-driven research in stut-

tering involves isolating factors that differentially affect
speech production in speakers who do and do not stutter.
This allows investigators to make inferences regarding the
factors that play a contributory role in stuttering. Work in
this area has focused primarily on the impact of linguistic
complexity, using speech variability (i.e., the inconsistency
in speech movements across repeated utterances) as a proxy
for speech function. This work reveals that speakers who
stutter tend to exhibit greater speech variability than speakers
who do not stutter when their systems are stressed syntacti-
cally (Cai et al., 2011; Kleinow & Smith, 2000) and phono-
logically (Smith, Goffman, Sasisekaran, & Weber-Fox, 2012;
Smith, Sadagopan, Walsh, & Weber-Fox, 2010). Such find-
ings have been interpreted as evidence that the speech motor
systems of speakers who stutter are more susceptible to

when stressed linguistically (e.g., Kleinow & Smith, 2000;
MacPherson & Smith, 2013). However, variability in behav-
ior is a complex phenomenon that reflects both stable and
unstable underlying processes (M. A. Riley & Turvey, 2002;
van Lieshout & Namasivayam, 2010). The current study
extends the variability paradigm into the social–cognitive
domain and implements both commonly used across-
sentences measures and novel within-sentence measures to
assess and interpret speech variability in adults who stutter
(AWS) and adults who do not stutter (AWNS).

Social–Cognitive Stress

Alm (2014) posited that interference from social cog-

nition contributes to stuttering. Social cognition refers
broadly to an individual’s expectations or the expectations
of others in the individual’s environment regarding how
that individual should act or behave (Alm, 2014). For
speakers who stutter, interference from social cognition
may include a desire for uninterrupted communication de-
spite its unlikeliness or negative expectations for how the
listener(s) in the speaker’s environment will react to their
speech. The cognitive processes (e.g., dissonance, anxiety)
associated with the possibility of speech disruption or a
negative listener reaction may compete with the sensori-
motor resources necessary to produce fluent speech, and
the speech motor systems of AWS may indeed be vulnerable
to this type of interference.

Little is known about the impact of social–cognitive

stress on speech variability or speech production in gen-
eral. One example of social–cognitive stress is speaking in
the presence of an audience. This increases communicative
pressure and the potential for negative evaluation or judg-
ment, particularly for AWS (Arenas, 2012), which potentially
elicits cognitive responses such as increased (or decreased)
speech awareness, attention, and/or anxiety.1 Audience pres-
ence has been linked to increases in stuttered speech in several
studies (Commodore, 1980; Steer & Johnson, 1936; Van
Riper & Hull, 1955; von Krais Porter, 1939), but to the best
of our knowledge its impact on speech variability has been
examined in only one study. Evans (2009) measured acoustic
variability in terms of vowel, phrase, and word duration;
voice onset time; and formant transition duration, extent,
and rate. That study did not find significant group differ-
ences between the audience and nonaudience conditions,
but this may have been because (a) duration-based measures
will not reflect differences in articulatory patterning and
(b) measures that are based on single sound segments (i.e.,
voice onset time, formant transitions) will not detect spatio-
temporal differences in connected speech.

1Speaking or performing in the presence of an audience may elicit
both cognitive and emotional responses (i.e., autonomic arousal), but
disentangling these overlapping processes was not the focus of the
current study. Here, anxiety refers to a cognitive response including
evaluation of and reflection on the current situation.

There is reason to expect that social–cognitive stress

(here, the presence of an audience) will result in reduced
variability in AWS. AWS exhibit reductions in heart rate
compared with AWNS prior to stressful speaking situations
(Peters & Hulstijn, 1984; Weber & Smith, 1990) as well
as increased acoustic startle response magnitude (Guitar,
2003), which is an indicator of reactivity or the ability
to prepare the body for upcoming aversive stimuli. Both
responses are associated with motor “freezing” (Alm, 2004),
which may temporarily restrict or partially immobilize the
motor system. Indeed, van Lieshout, Ben-David, Lipski,
and Namasivayam (2014) demonstrated that AWS exhibit
smaller upper lip movement ranges when speaking under
cognitive and emotional stress. It may be that this partial
immobilization of the speech articulators is a compensation
mechanism for underlying difficulty or malfunction, and
a reduction in variability may be a motor strategy for
maintaining fluent speech under aversive stimuli (see also
Namasivayam & van Lieshout, 2011). Other neurologically
based or developmental impairments are associated with
reduced variability and a restrictive motor system. For
example, individuals with Parkinson’s disease, obsessive
compulsive disorder, and myelogenous leukemia and those
on the autism spectrum exhibit stereotypical or overly
deterministic (i.e., patterned) motor behaviors (Goldberger,
1996, 1997).

This section focused on situations during which
speakers maintain perceptually fluent speech because overtly
stuttered speech would undoubtedly result in increased
across-sentence variability. Some have questioned the
utility of the so-called fluent speech paradigm (e.g., Armson
& Kalinowski, 1994; Bloodstein & Bernstein-Ratner, 2008),
primarily because perceptually fluent speech samples may
be contaminated by instances of stuttering that are harder to
observe (Armson & Kalinowski, 1994). However, a poten-
tial advantage of this paradigm is that “tenuous fluency”
(Adams & Runyan, 1981, p. 206) or “subperceptual stutter-
ing” (Armson & Kalinowski, 1994, p. 70) can actually
be measured. These subtle forms of stuttering may be
unavailable to even the most trained of perceivers but
measurable using sophisticated techniques and equipment.
Because we are investigating perceptually fluent speech in
terms of variability, it is critical now to discuss how speech
variability is interpreted in the context of speech motor
control and stuttering.

Interpreting Speech Variability

The most widely used metric for assessing speech
variability is the spatiotemporal index (STI; Smith, Goffman,
Zelaznik, Ying, & McGillem, 1995). The STI is a linear
amplitude- and time-normalized metric that assesses vari-
ability across a set of utterances. Smith and colleagues
(Smith et al., 1995; Smith, Johnson, McGillem, & Goffman,
2000) rationalized the value of the STI as follows: If speech
is preprogrammed, then unperturbed repetitions of a single
utterance produced by a typically fluent speaker should
reveal consistent movement patterns with high stability and

children exhibit greater speech variability than adults
(Maner, Smith, & Grayson, 2000; Smith & Goffman, 1998;
Smith & Zelaznik, 2004), that the speech systems of people
who stutter are more vulnerable to system stress than those
of people who do not stutter (Cai et al., 2011; Jackson, Tiede,
& Whalen, 2013; Kleinow & Smith, 2000; MacPherson &
Smith, 2013; Smith et al., 2010, 2012; Smith & Kleinow,
2000), and that individuals with Parkinson’s disease are more
variable in speech output than those without Parkinson’s
disease (Anderson, Lowit, & Howell, 2008; Kleinow, Smith,
& Ramig, 2001).

There are three inherent limitations related to the

interpretation of the STI in the context of speech and stut-
tering. First, the STI quantifies variability across speech
utterances, which assumes that repeated utterances produced
by a typical speaker should converge kinematically (Smith
et al., 1995). Although increased articulatory variability
may reflect instability in the speech motor system, it may
also reflect an alternative—but not less fluent—speaking
strategy (e.g., altered prosody or syllable stress; Dromey,
Boyce, & Channell, 2014; Maner et al., 2000). Second, the
STI requires time normalization through the consistent
alignment of the beginnings and ends of utterances, which
distorts potentially important temporal information (Lucero,
2005; Lucero, Munhall, Gracco, & Ramsay, 1997; Ward &
Arnfield, 2001). This is particularly relevant to stuttering
because as a group, people who stutter exhibit significantly
longer utterance durations or slower speech rates than
people who do not stutter (Bloodstein, 1944; Colcord
& Adams, 1979; Jackson, 2015; Starkweather & Myers,
1979). Third, the STI holds that there is an inverse relation-
ship between variability in behavior and global stability of
the speech motor system (as described in Smith et al., 1995).
That AWS exhibit greater STI (on average) than AWNS
when their systems are stressed linguistically therefore
implies that the speech motor systems of AWS become
less stable under these conditions. However, several under-
lying processes (e.g., cognitive, linguistic) contribute to the
emergence of speech and stuttering. As such, variability in
peripheral behavior cannot by itself be used to characterize
global speech motor function. For example, it may be the
case that reduced variability in behavior reflects a system
on the verge of breaking down (M. A. Riley & Turvey,
2002). We propose a dynamical systems account of vari-
ability (e.g., M. A. Riley & Turvey, 2002; Spencer, Perone,
& Johnson, 2009; van Lieshout & Namasivayam, 2010),
such that variability in observable behavior(s) can reflect
both vulnerability in the speech motor system and flexibility
or adaptability to changing contextual demands or other
perturbations. This distinction is critical for testing the hypoth-
esis proposed earlier—that AWS will exhibit reduced vari-
ability compared with AWNS under social–cognitive stress.

The concept of speech variability in the context of

stuttering needs to be expanded if it is to be used to examine
the impact of system stressors on speech motor functioning
(as also argued by van Lieshout & Namasivayam, 2010). We
argue that the STI is a useful tool for quantifying differences

between AWS and AWNS across repeated productions
but that it should be complemented by approaches that
characterize speech within productions or utterances with-
out distorting the temporal structure of speech and without
assuming an inverse relationship between variability in
behavior and global speech stability. Here, we complement
STI with recurrence quantification analysis (RQA; Webber,
2004; Webber & Marwan, 2015; Webber & Zbilut, 1994,
2005).

RQA

RQA is a technique used to identify patterns in
individual time series and so does not require time normal-
ization procedures. Whereas the STI is used to examine
spatiotemporal characteristics across a set of utterances (i.e.,
how well these utterances converge onto a motor “template”),
RQA reveals spatiotemporal characteristics within speech
utterances (i.e., how the dynamics evolve throughout the
utterance). As typically implemented, RQA uses the phase
space reconstruction method to retrieve the dynamics that
underlie a system when only one variable of that system
is known. These dynamics are represented when the known
time series and its time-delayed copies are plotted in a phase
space (Eckmann, Kamphorst, & Ruelle, 1987; Takens,
1981). For example, the dynamics of lip aperture (LA)
during speech production, as well as the dynamics of other
variables hypothesized to be part of that speech system (e.g.,
movements of other articulators, social–cognitive pro-
cesses), will be reflected in a phase space plot of the time
series for LA and its time-delayed copies. Recurrence plots
(Eckmann et al., 1987) are then generated and a series of
RQA measures are calculated, including indices that reflect
determinism and stability (discussed in detail in the Method
section). RQA addresses the reality that in speech and stut-
tering, multiple processes (e.g., linguistic, social–cognitive)
underlie observable behavior.

RQA has been used to show that individuals affected

by Parkinson’s disease (Schmit et al., 2006) and stroke
(Ghomashchi, Esteki, Nasrabadi, Sprott, & Bahrpeyma,
2011) exhibit more deterministic motor movements com-
pared with individuals not affected by these conditions.
Work from our lab (Jackson, Tiede, Riley, & Whalen,
2016) demonstrates the feasibility of using RQA to examine
the impact of linguistic stressors on speech in typically
developing adult speakers. For a tutorial-like presentation
of RQA, including phase space reconstruction, see Webber
and Zbilut (2005). For an example of RQA applied to speech
data, see Jackson et al. (2016).

The purpose of this study was to examine the impact

of social–cognitive stress on speech variability (including
determinism and stability) in AWS and AWNS. Comple-
menting existing measures (i.e., the STI) with novel methods
(i.e., RQA) provided a means to both quantify variability
across utterances and characterize spatiotemporal patterning
of speech within utterances, allowing for new interpretations
related to the nature of variability in stuttering and speech
motor control.

This research was approved by the institutional review

board at the Graduate Center of the City University of
New York (CUNY) and the National Stuttering Association
Research Committee.

Participants

This study enrolled 24 AWS and 21 AWNS (i.e.,
controls) matched for age and sex. AWS were recruited
via referrals from local speech-language pathologists (SLPs),
e-mails distributed by the National Stuttering Association
and within CUNY, and word of mouth. AWNS were
recruited via e-mails distributed within CUNY and word
of mouth. Three AWS were excluded because they did not
produce at least 10 fluent trials for each sentence-condition
set (more on exclusionary criteria below). An additional
AWS was excluded due to technical malfunction and data
loss. Thus, the current analysis included 20 AWS (six women,
14 men; mean age = 27.4 years, SD = 6.9) and 21 AWNS
(seven women, 14 men; mean age = 25.3 years, SD = 2.5).
Table 1 summarizes participant characteristics, formal and
informal test scores, and therapy history. Therapy history
was determined by asking participants what their cumulative
time in therapy had been. All participants (except for the
two who reported no therapy) reported participating in
standard therapy approaches (e.g., stuttering modification,
fluency shaping). All of the participants reported that their
primary language was English and that they had mastered
English before the age of 6 years.2 No participants reported
a positive history of speech-language disorder (other than
stuttering) or hearing, neurological, or psychological
impairment.

Stuttering diagnosis was made by the first author,
a licensed SLP with extensive experience in the area of
stuttering. Assessment included a detailed case history and
interview and administration of the Overall Assessment
of the Speaker’s Experience of Stuttering (Yaruss & Quesal,
2008) and the Stuttering Severity Index–Fourth Edition
(G. D. Riley, 2009). In addition, the Expressive One-Word
Picture Vocabulary Test–Third Edition (EOWPVT-3; Martin
& Brownell, 2000) was administered informally as a screener
of expressive language skills. The EOWPVT-3 is normed
up to age 18;11 (years;months), with a raw score of 116 being
the norm for the oldest age group. Although the current
participants were older than the oldest normed group, all
of them attained a raw score of at least 116, which is 1 SD
below the mean test score (Martin & Brownell, 2000). De-
scriptive statistics revealed that the AWNS exhibited a
higher mean score than the AWS (109.33 and 103.70, respec-
tively), but the difference was not significant, F(1, 39) = 2.36,

2Multilingual speakers were not excluded because it was determined that
the benefits of including them (e.g., larger sample, more heterogeneous
group) outweighed potential confounds (e.g., decreased language and/or
speech ability due to less exposure to English).

p > .05. All participants passed a pure-tone hearing screening
at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz at 20 dB HL. Identification
of psychological or neurological impairment was based on
self-report.

Procedure

The consent process, diagnostic testing, and experi-

mental procedures were completed in one session that
lasted 90 to 120 min. To measure lip movement, an Opto-
trak Certus 3020 (Northern Digital, Waterloo, Ontario,
Canada) was used. The Optotrak uses three cameras to
quantify the movement of infrared light–emitting diodes
(IREDs) in three dimensions. In this study, the IREDs
were placed midsagittally at the vermillion border of the
upper and lower lips. An Audio-Technica (Tokyo, Japan)
MicroSet directional microphone was placed approxi-
mately 20 cm in front of the participant’s mouth for audio
recording.

Stimuli were presented on a 20-in. computer monitor

using Presentation software (Neurobehavioral Systems,
Albany, CA). The monitor was placed 12 to 16 in. beside
the Optotrak camera unit, which minimized potential inter-
ference emitted from the screen. The Optotrak camera
unit was placed approximately 2 m from participants (see
Figure 1). Because Optotrak relies on line of sight to its
cameras, participants were instructed before data collection
to test the range of IRED tracking by moving their heads
to the left and right; they were provided with verbal feed-
back when this movement caused the IREDS to go out of
range. IREDs were monitored via First Principles (Northern
Digital), the proprietary software for the Optotrak. Partici-
pants were instructed to attempt to remain stationary during
the experiment, although small amounts of movement were
permitted as long as IRED view was not obstructed (see
below regarding trials that were discarded due to IRED
obstruction).

Participants were verbally instructed by the first author

to use a “normal” speaking voice during the experiment.
Instructions were presented via the monitor (e.g., “Please
read the sentences as they appear on the screen”). Stimuli
were adapted from Kleinow and Smith (2000). The target
utterance, “Buy Bobby a puppy,” was produced in isolation
(referred to as Base) as well as embedded in one “longer only”
sentence (L1; i.e., “Four one three two five buy Bobby a
puppy ten eight nine eleven”) and two longer and more
complex sentences. The two longer and more complex sen-
tences contained differing levels of embedded perspective
(Whalen, Zunshine, & Holquist, 2012; Zunshine, 2006).
These linguistically complex stimuli included “He wants
Karen to tell John to buy Bobby a puppy at my store”
(P1; level 1 embedment) and “You want Samantha to buy
Bobby a puppy now if he wants one” (P2; level 2 embedment).
Results related to the differing levels of linguistic complex-
ity are not reported in this article, although Base, L1, P1,
and P2 are included as fixed factors in the statistical models
(see the Statistical Analysis section below).

Each of the four sentences was presented 20 times in
pseudorandomized order for a total of 80 trials. The entire
sequence was repeated for the “audience” condition (see
below) with a different pseudorandom order for a total of
160 trials. Audience and nonaudience blocks were counter-
balanced such that half of the participants were exposed to
the audience condition first and the other half were exposed
to the nonaudience condition first.

The audience condition tested the effect of having two

unseen observers present along with the seen experimenter.
During that condition, two unfamiliar observers (one man
and one woman) entered the testing room and remained
out of sight for the duration of the block. The observers’

entrance was timed to a text message sent by the examiner.
Prior to the experiment, participants were told, “Observers
may enter the room during the experiment—just ignore
anybody that comes into the room.” The observers entered
the room by opening a large door (easily audible for those
with typical hearing) and sat in two chairs directly behind
the participants so that participants were unable to see them.
This minimized potential bias due to observer appearance.
Observers deliberately coughed three to five times through-
out the block so that participants could realize that the
observers were a man and a woman—which all but two male
participants were able to do (both instead thought that the
audience consisted of two men). This minimized potential

bias due to the sex of the participant. In addition to
coughing, observers were instructed to scribble audibly
on a pad approximately 10 times during the session,
with the goal of increasing social–cognitive stress on the
participants.

Stimuli (i.e., Base, L1, P1, and P2) were presented

one at a time on the computer monitor. Each sentence ap-
peared on the monitor for 5 s followed by 1 s of silence
with a blank screen. All participants either completed the
sentences (stuttered or nonstuttered) within 5 s or discon-
tinued speech (i.e., stopped talking) when the blank screen
appeared. After both blocks were completed, participants
completed a short questionnaire that assessed their ability to
identify the gender of their observers as well as subjective

ratings of anxiety during the audience and nonaudience
conditions3 using a Likert scale questionnaire (see the
Appendix).

3The current work was not intended to provide a comprehensive
examination of anxiety in AWS and AWNS. Anxiety as it relates to
stuttering is a complex phenomenon that has social, cognitive, and
emotional components. The term anxiety was used in the questionnaire
to increase the probability that participants would be able to (a) identify
with the kind of social–cognitive stress introduced (i.e., speaking in
front of an audience) that was introduced during the experiment and
(b) report it.

Dependent Variables

The 20 productions of each utterance were collected

to increase the probability that participants produced at
least 10 fluent and usable utterances during each condition
for all sentences. The first 10 fluent and usable trials have
been used to calculate STI in past studies (e.g., Dromey
et al., 2014; Kleinow & Smith, 2000, 2006; MacPherson &
Smith, 2013; Smith & Kleinow, 2000), and that selection
was used here. Fluent or disfluent utterances were identified
as such during the experiment by the first author and then
subsequently verified offline by the first author and an addi-
tional licensed and certified SLP. Fluent utterances were
those free from atypical and typical disfluencies, hesitations,
pauses, interjections, rewording, and aberrant prosody (as
in Kleinow & Smith, 2000). To further operationalize the
categorization of fluency or disfluency, utterances with
pauses or gaps exceeding 6% of total utterance duration
were considered disfluent (following Jackson, 2015). In
that study, 6% was suggested as a threshold because it was
the approximate point at which 80% of utterances were
selected to be fluent. Regarding fluency of the full sentences,
if the target utterance (i.e., “Buy Bobby a puppy”) was per-
ceptually fluent, disfluency exhibited at other parts of the
sentences (for L1, P1, and P2) did not preclude inclusion of
the target utterance. Despite research that suggests exclud-
ing these utterances because of the potential influence of
stuttering on surrounding kinematics (e.g., Pindzola, 1986;
Prosek & Runyan, 1982; Shapiro, 1980), the current authors
elected to examine all utterances that met the criteria set
forth for perceptually fluent speech during the core target
utterance. Examining utterances that are perceptually flu-
ent but that are surrounded by clear instances of stuttering
increases the probability that there will be subtle differences
in fluent speech. Of 3,200 AWS trials, 200 target utterances
(6.3%) were disfluent (e.g., stuttered, contained speech errors)
and 56 (or 1.8%) contained technical errors. Of the 200 AWS
disfluent utterances, 87 (43.5%) occurred during the audience
condition and 113 (56.5%) occurred during the nonaudience
condition. Of 3,360 AWNS trials, 81 target utterances (2.4%)
were disfluent and 42 (1.3%) yielded technical errors. Of the
81 AWNS disfluent utterances, 46 (56.8%) occurred during
the audience condition and 35 (43.2%) occurred during the
nonaudience condition.

Following Jackson et al. (2016), kinematic signals

were sampled at 250 Hz and subsequently low-pass filtered
at 10 Hz. Audio signals were low-pass filtered prior to
recording using a hardware filter at 7500 Hz and then
sampled at 16500 Hz. LA was calculated as the Euclidean
distance between the upper and lower lips. The registration
landmarks for each target utterance (i.e., “Buy Bobby a
puppy”) were determined by the peak velocities of the
first lip opening movement (i.e., after /b/ in Buy) and
the last opening movement (i.e., /pi/ in puppy), respec-
tively (as in Smith et al., 1995). Custom procedures in
MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA) were used to identify
these points and to calculate STI on the delimited LA
trajectories.

The dependent variables reflected across-sentence
variability (i.e., STI), within-sentence determinism and
stability (i.e., RQA measures), and sentence duration.

STI

LA STI4 measured variability across the first 10 fluent

and usable trials for each condition and sentence for each
participant. To calculate LA STI, signals were amplitude
and time normalized using the methodology of Smith et al.
(1995). To normalize for amplitude, the mean was subtracted
from each amplitude value of the trajectory and then divided
by the standard deviation. Time normalization was achieved
by (a) removing the linear trend of each amplitude-normalized
signal, (b) computing the fast Fourier transform of the
detrended signals, (c) mapping 10 retained coefficients onto
a consistent time base of 1,000 points, and (d) reapplying the
linear trend. Standard deviations were then calculated by bin-
ning samples for the first 10 viable trials of a given sentence
and condition combination at 2% intervals. The sum of these
50 standard deviations produced the LA STI for that sen-
tence or condition. Figure 2 illustrates these calculations.

RQA

RQA with phase space reconstruction followed the
same procedures as outlined in Jackson et al. (2016). The
top panel in Figure 3 presents a raw time series reflecting
LA during “Buy Bobby a puppy” for one participant during
one trial. The middle panel of Figure 3 represents that same
time series in a reconstructed phase space, with the original
time series plotted on the x-axis and the time-delayed copy
plotted on the y-axis (DELAY parameter is 4; EMBED
parameter is 2).5 A Euclidean distance matrix was then con-
structed on the basis of the phase space plot and subsequently
transformed into a recurrence matrix using a radius param-
eter of 15% of the mean distance. The recurrence plot as
presented in the bottom panel of Figure 3 is based on this
recurrence matrix; points that reach the threshold are plotted,
whereas points below the threshold are not plotted. An
explicit example of distance and recurrence matrix con-
struction and recurrence plot generation for one time series
from the current experiment is provided in Jackson et al.
(2016). RQA indices were calculated on the basis of stan-
dard heuristics applied to the recurrence plots and resulted in
percentage determinism (%DET) and stability (MAXLINE)
measures.

Determinism

%DET measures degree of determinism. It is assumed

in RQA that behavior is governed by a dynamical system

4Known as LA variability index in previous studies (e.g., Kleinow &
Smith, 2006; MacPherson & Smith, 2013).
5Phase space reconstruction and RQA require a priori parameter
selection (e.g., delay length, dimension size, radius, line length). For a
complete discussion regarding parameter selection, see Webber and
Zbilut (2005).

observable. Determinism indicates how patterned versus
random this underlying dynamical system is (Webber &
Zbilut, 2005). In this context it is a plausible reflection of
speech-planning processes (i.e., patterned is planned; random
is not planned), where higher determinism reveals that the
dynamical system underlying speech production is more
highly structured, and low determinism reflects a system that
is less structured. %DET was calculated as the percentage
of points in the recurrence plot out of all recurrent points
that were part of diagonal lines that were at least 5 points
in length. For example, there are 1,127 points in the bottom
right triangle of the recurrence plot at the bottom of Figure 3,
not including the line of identity (i.e., the center diagonal) or
the top left triangle. (The top left triangle is not used because
it is a mirror image of the bottom right triangle.) Of these,
1,018 points fall on diagonal lines of at least 5 points. %DET
for this particular recurrence plot equals 90.33% (1,018/1,127).
Note that %DET values are not absolute, such that a tra-
jectory that exhibits 95%DET is 95% deterministic. Rather,
%DET values provide a useful comparison across a set of
related signals to determine which instances are more and
less deterministic.

Stability and Duration

MAXLINE measures the stability of the underlying

dynamical system. Stability is related to the system dynamics
such that lower stability reflects higher inherent chaotic
behavior (Eckmann et al., 1987; Webber & Zbilut, 2005).
A speech motor system that exhibits a high degree of sta-
bility is not likely to be influenced or perturbed by noise
or other factors (e.g., social–cognitive or linguistic stress),
whereas a speech system that exhibits low stability would
be susceptible to this kind of interference. It is critical to note
that stability is not simply the inverse of across-sentence
variability (as measured by the STI). Rather, stability is
one aspect of spatiotemporal patterning that is measured
within a single time series. Stability (i.e., MAXLINE) is
calculated as the longest sequence of consecutive diagonal
data points excluding the line of identity in the recurrence
plot (because longer diagonal lines signify that local pattern-
ing in the phase space is less likely to be interrupted). For
example, MAXLINE for the recurrence plot at the bottom
of Figure 3 is 106. Duration was calculated as the time in
milliseconds between trajectory registration points (i.e., the
LA peak velocity immediately following the release of /b/ in
Buy and the peak velocity immediately following the second
/p/ in puppy).

Statistical Analysis

Linear mixed-effects (LME) models were created
using the lme4 package (Bates, Maechler, Bolker, & Walker,
2014, p. 4) in R (R Core Team, 2014). The lmerTest package
(Kuznetsova, Brockhoff, & Christensen, 2014) was used to
estimate degrees of freedom and p values on the basis of
Satterthwaite approximations. Although estimating degrees
of freedom in lmer models is controversial (e.g., Baayen,

Davidson, & Bates, 2008; Barr, Levy, Scheepers, & Tily,
2013), the lmerTest values reported here represent an emerg-
ing standard provided to facilitate interpretation of the
results.

There were two classes of models for across-sentence

(i.e., STI) and within-sentence (i.e., RQA, duration) measures.
Because previous research shows that AWS and AWNS
exhibit different speech patterning during perceptually
fluent speech production at least some of the time, a fixed
effect of primary interest for the across-sentence measures
was group, which had two levels (i.e., AWS, AWNS). Because
research also suggests that these patterns are influenced by
linguistic and social–cognitive factors, both sentence (i.e.,
Base, L1, P1, P2) and condition (i.e., audience, nonaudience)
were also included as fixed effects. Participant was modeled
as a random effect to adjust for (generally expected) varia-
tion in intercept due to individual differences in production
and repeated measures. To determine which interactions
to include in the model(s) to yield the best fit and minimize
overfitting, possible models (e.g., including group*condition,
and group*sentence interactions, a group*condition*sentence
interaction) were compared using a likelihood ratio test. The
model with the lowest Bayesian information criterion (BIC)
was selected—in this case, lmer(STI ~ group*condition +
group*sentence + (1|participant)).

Within-sentence analyses must also account for trial
effects. The baseline model was identical to the model used
for the across-sentence measures—that is, lmer(RQA ~
group*condition + group*sentence + (1|participant))—with
the dependent variable RQA representing either of the
RQA measures (%DET, MAXLINE) or duration. Measures
associated with speech motor control may be affected by
experimental familiarity or fatigue, which would be reflected
in performance over trials. To determine whether adding
trial to the model provided a better fit for the data, a model
including c.(trial) as a fixed factor was compared with a
model without c.(trial). Centering (i.e., c.) reduced the
probability of spurious correlations in the model and was
achieved by subtracting the overall mean from each trial
number without scaling (Baayen, 2008). The model includ-
ing c.(trial) yielded a lower BIC value than the model
without c.(trial), suggesting an improved model fit. Further-
more, it was plausible that there were random trial effects
by participant. A model including random slopes by partic-
ipant for c.(trial) was compared with a model without
this factor. A lower BIC value justified the inclusion of
the random slopes for trial by participant. The model used
for the within-sentence analyses was lmer(RQA_index ~
group*condition + group*sentence + c.(trial) + (1+c.(trial)|
participant)).

Results

A subset of the data (from the control group for the
nonaudience condition) was also reported in Jackson et al.
(2016). In addition, the effects of linguistic complexity are
not reported here, although they are available in the first
author’s doctoral dissertation (Jackson, 2015). Table 2

includes coefficients for the model, t values, estimated
degrees of freedom and p values, Cohen’s d values, and R2
values. Only a portion of these results is presented below.
Following Baayen (2008), t values of 2 or greater were con-
sidered to be significant. Cohen’s d provided an indication
of effect size and was calculated by dividing the mean dif-
ference between the dependent measures by the residual
standard deviation of the model. R2 provided an estimate
of how well the LME models fit the actual data.

Across Sentences and Conditions

The AWS exhibited greater across-sentence vari-

ability (STI) than AWNS across conditions and sentences
(t = 1.98, p = .0506). AWS also exhibited greater deter-
minism (i.e., %DET; t = 3.14, p < .01) and greater stability
(i.e., MAXLINE; t = 2.16, p < .05) compared with AWNS,
indicating that AWS—despite being more variable across
utterances—were also more deterministic and more stable
within utterances.

Presence of an Audience

Although the audience condition did not differentiate
between groups for across-sentence variability, it did affect
within-sentence spatiotemporal features. A significant
Group × Condition interaction (t = −3.77, p < .001) was
found for %DET, indicating that AWS and AWNS responded
differently to the presence of an audience. To assess whether
one condition or the other was driving the group difference,
post hoc tests were administered. The AWS exhibited greater
determinism than the AWNS during the audience condition
(t = 2.55, p = .01; Bonferroni adjustment at α/4 = .0125) but
not during the nonaudience condition (see Figure 4). AWS
exhibited greater determinism during the audience condi-
tion compared with the nonaudience condition (t = −5.07,
p < .001; Bonferroni correction at α/4 = .0125), but there were
no differences between conditions for AWNS. Regarding

stability, a significant Group × Condition interaction
(t = 2.00, p < .05; Bonferroni adjustment at α/4 = .0125)
warranted post hoc testing. AWS exhibited greater stability
in the audience condition compared with the nonaudience
condition (t = −3.5, p < .001; Bonferroni adjustment at
α/4 = .0125), but AWNS did not exhibit this pattern (see
Figure 5).

Shifters

It is generally accepted that the factors that contribute
to stuttering vary across individuals and that stuttering sub-
groups likely exist in this regard (Ambrose, Yairi, Loucks,
Seery, & Throneburg, 2015; Seery, Watkins, Mangelsdorf,
& Shigeto, 2007; Yairi, 2007). It is feasible that only those
AWS who report a marked difference in subjective anxiety
between nonaudience and audience conditions would alter
their productions when subjected to this kind of social–
cognitive stress. These “shifters” were participants who
reported anxiety to be at least 2 points higher during the
audience condition compared with the nonaudience condition
(using the Likert scale in the Appendix). A shift of 2 points
was estimated a priori to be an appropriate threshold for
determining a significant change in self-reported anxiety levels
for AWS and AWNS. There were six shifter AWS (all men)
and five shifter AWNS (three men, two women), all of
whom reported a change of 2 points, except for one female
AWNS who reported a change of 3 points. Shifter AWS
exhibited significantly lower variability during the audience
condition compared with the nonaudience condition (t = 3.12,
p < .01; Bonferroni adjustment at α/4 = .0125); AWNS
did not follow this pattern (see Figure 6). It is interesting
to note that the nonshifter AWS exhibited greater variability
during the audience condition compared with the non-
audience condition (t = −2.65, p < .01; Bonferroni adjust-
ment at α/4 = .0125). Descriptive statistics revealed that the
mean EOWPVT-3 score for the shifter AWNS was higher
than that for the shifter AWS (114.0 and 106.3, respectively),
but the difference was not significant, F(1, 9) = −0.81, p > .05.

There were no significant within-group or within-
condition findings observed for shifter AWS related to
determinism other than the fact that they exhibited greater
determinism than the shifter AWNS (t = 2.70, p < .05).
Nonshifter AWS exhibited greater determinism than non-
shifter AWNS (t = 2.33, p < .05) and exhibited greater
determinism (t = −6.05, p < .001) and stability (t = −4.72,
p < .001) in the audience condition compared with the
nonaudience condition.

Duration

The AWS exhibited longer utterance durations than

AWNS across all conditions and sentences (t = 3.26, p < .01).
A significant Group × Condition interaction warranted
examination into within-group differences between condi-
tions, but no between-conditions differences were found.
Because there have been questions related to the
influence of duration on kinematic speech measures (specif-
ically those assessing across-sentence variability), Pearson’s
correlations were calculated between the dependent vari-
ables and utterance duration. There was a positive correla-
tion between duration and across-sentence variability (LA
STI; r = .50, p = .001); this correlation approached signifi-
cance for AWS (r = .42, p < .10) but not AWNS (r = .22,
p > .10; see Figure 7). Significant correlations were not
observed overall for %DET (r = .30, p > .10); this corre-
lation was not significant for AWS (r = .11, p > .10) but
was significant for AWNS (r = .64, p < .01). Significant
correlations were observed for MAXLINE (r = .81, p < .001),
which held for AWS (r = .78, p < .001) and AWNS (r = .86,
p < .001).

Discussion

The primary purpose of this study was to examine

the impact of social–cognitive stress on speech variability,
determinism, and stability in AWS and AWNS. Overall (i.e.,
across conditions and sentence types), the AWS exhibited

greater across-sentence variability than the AWNS, corrob-
orating previous findings (e.g., Cai et al., 2011; Kleinow
& Smith, 2000; MacPherson & Smith, 2013; Smith et al.,
2010). However, the speech of the AWS within sentences
was also characterized as more deterministic and stable
compared with the speech of the AWNS. Social–cognitive
stress (i.e., the presence of an audience) increased within-
sentence determinism and stability in the AWS but did not
affect across-sentence variability. A subset of the data
including those speakers who reported a marked increase
in anxiety between the nonaudience and audience condi-
tion revealed that these shifter AWS exhibited reduced
variability in the audience condition compared with the
nonaudience condition. The AWS exhibited longer utter-
ance durations than the AWNS across conditions and sen-
tences, and this was not necessarily due to social–cognitive
or linguistic stress.

Greater across-sentence variability and greater
within-trial determinism and stability in AWS compared
with AWNS suggest that AWS are less able to maintain
consistent speech patterns across repeated utterances as
well as between articulatory gestures within utterances.
These findings were not surprising. If stuttering signatures
during perceptually fluent speech are indeed intermittent
(here, from utterance to utterance), it follows that some
sentences will be produced with a greater degree of patterning
than others. If some sentences reveal high within-sentence
determinism and stability and others do not, variability
measured across trials will be higher than if all of the sen-
tences were produced with typical determinism or stability.
Commenting on the complex relationship between variability
in behavior and determinism, Riley and Turvey (2002)
argue that “more variable does not mean more random
and more controllable does not mean more deterministic”
(p. 99; also see van Lieshout & Namasivayam, 2010). It
may be that increased across-sentence variability coupled
with increased within-trial determinism and stability reflect
a lack of speech motor control, perhaps indicating excessive
determinism and overstability. Stressing the speech motor
system allowed us to further test this hypothesis.

Impact of Audience Presence

Speaking in front of an audience has been shown

to increase overt stuttering for AWS (Commodore, 1980;
Steer & Johnson, 1936; Van Riper & Hull, 1955; von Krais
Porter, 1939). Our study examined the influence of audi-
ence presence on sentence-level speech kinematics during
connected speech. The AWS and AWNS exhibited similar
speech dynamics during the nonaudience condition, but
the AWS were more deterministic and stable compared
with the AWNS in the audience condition and more deter-
ministic in the audience condition compared with the non-
audience condition. These findings indicate that AWS may
adopt a rigid approach to speech production to compen-
sate for underlying difficulty secondary to social–cognitive
stress (i.e., the presence of an audience). This interpretation
is in line with proposals by van Lieshout and colleagues

2004) and Alm (2014) that AWS are less flexible in adapt-
ing to social, cognitive, and/or linguistic stressors.

The findings reported in the previous paragraph are
also in line with the constrained action hypothesis, which
postulates that diverting an actor’s attention to external
stimuli facilitates motor performance, whereas diverting
attention internally (i.e., to the body) impedes performance
(e.g., Kal, Van der Kamp, & Houdijk, 2013; McNevin,
Shea, & Wulf, 2003; Wulf, McNevin, & Shea, 2001). That
is, focusing attention internally during relatively simple
motor tasks may have the effect of interfering with motor
actions because these tasks would otherwise be automatic.
Social–cognitive stress, which involves expectations by the
speaker for fluent speech or expectations regarding how
the listener will respond to the speaker, may cause a speaker
who is already susceptible to interference to shift attention
to his or her speech production system (i.e., internally). This
increased focus (or overfocus; also see Vasic & Wijnen,
2005) may therefore interfere with the otherwise subconscious
process of speech production.

Shifters

The AWS overall exhibited similar across-sentence

variability in the audience and nonaudience conditions even
though they were different for within-sentence determinism
and stability. The shifter AWS exhibited reduced across-
sentences variability during the audience condition compared
with the nonaudience condition. It is interesting to note
that the nonshifter AWS exhibited greater across-sentence
variability and greater within-sentence determinism or sta-
bility during the audience condition compared with the
nonaudience condition. The nonshifter AWS results appear
to more closely align with the general findings (including
all AWS and AWNS) that AWS exhibit greater speech
variability than AWNS, whereas the shifter AWS reveal
a pattern in the opposite direction (i.e., reduced variability
in the audience condition). These findings provide evidence
that those AWS who are more prone to experience a social–
cognitive response such as anxiety during a speaking task
will also be more likely than AWS who are less prone to
experience anxiety to alter their approach to speech pro-
duction (i.e., by becoming less variable across trials). That
nonshifter AWS exhibited greater variability in the audi-
ence condition compared with the nonaudience condition
highlights the critical impact that self-reported anxiety
plays in shaping speech behaviors.

Previous work shows that AWS exhibit greater across-
sentences variability when their speech systems are stressed
linguistically (Cai et al., 2011; Jackson, 2015; Kleinow &
Smith, 2000). It is reasonable to speculate that this effect
holds for shifter AWS because anxiety is not known to inter-
act with linguistic functioning. The current work shows that
the shifter AWS became less variable when social–cognitive
stress (i.e., audience presence) was introduced. It appears
that linguistic and social–cognitive stress may differen-
tially affect shifter AWS; linguistic stress results in increased

variability, and social–cognitive stress results in decreased
variability. One interpretation is that linguistic stress con-
tributes to a reduced ability to preserve speech kinematics
across repeated productions, whereas social–cognitive stress
contributes to a reduced capacity to maintain the necessary
variability required for speech production (i.e., to flexibly
and fluently move through speech movements). This claim
requires further testing.

Utterance Duration

The finding that AWS exhibited longer target utter-
ance durations than AWNS for all sentences was expected
on the basis of previous results (e.g., Bloodstein, 1944;
Colcord & Adams, 1979; Jackson, 2015; Starkweather &
Myers, 1979). Given the significant correlation between
duration and across-sentence variability (i.e., STI), it
followed that variability should be higher for those utter-
ances with longer durations. This was mostly the case:
AWS overall exhibited longer durations and greater across-
sentences variability. Furthermore, the current results
indicate that rate influenced variability more for AWS
compared with AWNS, suggesting that the within-group
durational variance was contributing in some way to these
correlations. However, there is also evidence from Jackson
(2015) that does not support the hypothesis that duration
influences across-sentence variability measures. For exam-
ple, one of the more complex sentences (i.e., P1) yielded
higher across-sentence variability than the Base phrase.
It may have been expected, then, that P1 should also have
exhibited longer durations than Base, but this was not the
case (Jackson, 2015). Although there is evidence that rate
influences across-sentence variability (i.e., the STI) from
the current and prior work (Dromey et al., 2014; Lucero
et al., 1997; Smith & Goffman, 1998; Smith et al., 1995;
Smith & Kleinow, 2000), it cannot be concluded that fluc-
tuations in the STI are solely due to durational fluctuations.
It was difficult to parse the effect of duration in this study
because it was treated as an additional dependent variable
—one that changed on the basis of the same factors as STI
and RQA (e.g., group, sentence, condition). Thus, it was
not included as a fixed or random effect in any of the statis-
tical models. For a detailed discussion regarding the influ-
ence of duration on the STI, see Jackson et al. (2016).

Within-sentence determinism appeared to be robust

to durational effects, as demonstrated by the lack of a
significant correlation between utterance duration and
determinism. This was expected given that determinism is
(a) reflected by a percentage value of the number of points
out of all possible points that are considered to be patterned
and (b) not subject to durational variability across a set of
trials (because it is measured within trials). Within-sentence
stability did, however, appear to be influenced by duration.
This was not surprising either given that stability (i.e.,
MAXLINE) is calculated as the longest string of consecu-
tive diagonal points in the recurrence plot. Longer time
series for relatively stable processes (i.e., repeating a simple
utterance that yields an approximately sinelike pattern) will

Jackson et al.: Social–Cognitive Stress and Stuttering 1309

Downloaded from: https://pubs.asha.org Michigan State University on 11/11/2025, Terms of Use: https://pubs.asha.org/pubs/rights_and_permissions yield longer consecutive strings of data points and, thus,
greater stability. The interpretation of stability therefore
requires consideration because AWS as a group are known to
exhibit a slower rate of speech compared with AWNS. Thus,
increased stability in AWS may be in part due to increased
duration and not solely representative of speech stability.

Theoretical Implications

Speech variability is a complex phenomenon that
can be assessed in various ways (e.g., within and across
sentences), and different approaches can lead to different
interpretations (van Lieshout & Namasivayam, 2010). For
example, the STI reveals that the speech kinematics of
AWS are generally more variable than those of AWNS
across sentences or utterances, whereas RQA indicates that
AWS are also more deterministic and stable within sentences
or utterances. Without using within-sentence measures, one
may interpret increased across-sentence variability as an
indication of reduced global stability secondary to random-
ness or noise in the speech motor system (e.g., see Smith
et al., 1995). However, increased levels of determinism and
stability within sentences show that the speech of these
same speakers may be characterized as overly stable or
produced in such a way that the speaker is attempting to
use too much control (see also Kleinow and Smith, 2000,
who reported that some AWS exhibited STI values at the
low end of the variability continuum). We approach this
problem from a dynamical systems perspective in which com-
plex biological systems are simultaneously variable and stable
and motor variability comprises both deterministic and
random components (M. A. Riley & Turvey, 2002).

From a dynamical perspective, a system that is overly

deterministic and overly stable represents a system on the
verge of breaking down. For example, prior work reveals
that pathological systems are characterized by increased
regularity or stereotypical (i.e., less flexible) behavioral
patterns (Goldberger, 1997), and both individuals with
Parkinson’s disease (Schmit et al., 2006) and stroke patients
(Ghomashchi et al., 2011) have been shown to exhibit
greater determinism than control participants. McClean,
Levandowski, and Cord (1994) found that AWS are less
variable than AWNS on various timing measures (e.g.,
onset of first vowel glottal cycle, maximum point of jaw
displacement). Kalveram (1993) demonstrated through
implementation of a neural network model of sensorimotor
learning that excessively strong couplings between underlying
neuronal populations responsible for speech led to reduced
motor variability and, subsequently, stuttering. Typically
functioning systems are continuously cycling through stability
and instability such that instabilities are required in order
for changes in states (e.g., gestural configurations) to occur.
Findings of greater determinism and greater stability in
AWS may represent (intermittent) rigidity and overstability,
which may be reflective of a compromised system—one
that exhibits difficulty in, for example, transitioning between
gestures (i.e., between onset and nucleus; Heyde, Scobbie,
Lickley, & Drake, 2016; Wingate, 1988). This hypothesis

would benefit from testing within a neurocomputational
framework of stuttering. This work is currently ongoing by
members of our research team.

Another important finding was that social–cognitive
and linguistic stressors appear to differentially affect across-
sentences variability in AWS, particularly for speakers
who are more susceptible to becoming anxious (i.e., shifters).
Social–cognitive stress appears to contribute to more restric-
tive and less variable across-sentence speech movements
in AWS, whereas linguistic stress contributes to more vari-
able across-sentence movements in AWS. Our results
provide additional support for the multifactorial view
of stuttering (e.g., Conture et al., 2006; Namasivayam &
van Lieshout, 2011; Smith & Kelly, 1997; Zimmermann,
1980). However, it is critical that theoretical accounts reflect
the reality that contextual stressors affecting differing under-
lying processes (i.e., social–cognitive, linguistic) may differ-
entially affect the speech motor system in AWS.

Clinical Implications

That AWS are more deterministic in their movements

during speech production suggests that AWS adopt a more
restrictive or rigid speech pattern to maintain fluent speech
despite underlying speech difficulty (see also Namasivayam
& van Lieshout, 2011). This strategy is likely associated with
increased muscle tension during speech production. Webber,
Schmidt, and Walsh (1995) found that unimpaired partici-
pants exhibited greater determinism in electromyographic
activity during heavy compared with light lifting. This may
be similar to what happens in AWS when their systems are
stressed in a social–cognitive way. It is well known clinically
that AWS exhibit significant articulator tension, facial and
neck tension, or tension in the chest or other parts of the
body as a result of stuttering. Most treatment approaches
involve some aspect of reducing tension during speech pro-
duction. For example, a “pullout” is a strategy in which
speakers identify articulatory tension during a stuttering
event and subsequently (attempt to) reduce that tension
to continue with speech production. Likewise, “light artic-
ulatory contacts” and “easy onsets” are speaking strategies
in which speakers initiate phonation with reduced tension,
either between the articulators (e.g., for consonant initial)
or in the larynx (e.g., for vowel initial). However, there is
little quantitative evidence to support the implementation
of these strategies. It is possible that measuring determinism
could facilitate the therapeutic approach of reducing tension
because it provides a straightforward index (percentage)
that may represent a degree of tension or restriction during
speech. It may be that increasing deterministic structure
allows the AWS to maintain fluent speech up to a certain
point but simultaneously is maladaptive in that the speaker
is teetering on the border of overt stuttering. This may be
the “tenuous fluency” that Adams and Runyan (1981) used
to characterize speech that was not overtly stuttered but
was not fluent either. Allowing speakers to find individually
specific ranges of determinism or “sweet spots” with the use
of objective measures such as determinism may facilitate

speech of AWS is on the verge of breaking down. Identifying
utterances that are individually difficult for AWS and then
using the same approach to identify determinism as detailed
in this article may be beneficial clinically. Of course, the
usefulness of such an approach needs to be tested.

The approach that many AWS take to coping with
stuttering—tensing or “pushing”—is likely maladaptive.
Indeed, most approaches to stuttering therapy (e.g., stutter-
ing modification, “normal talking,” fluency shaping), in
one way or another, propose that AWS produce speech
with less tension (e.g., pullouts, light articulatory contacts/
approximations; Johnson, Knott, & Leutenegger, 1955;
Lanyon, Barrington, & Newman, 1976; Manning, 2009;
Van Riper, 1973; Williams, 1957; Yairi & Seery, 2015). Given
that in the present study AWS who also exhibit higher
anxiety levels are those who tend to change their speaking
approach to a greater degree (e.g., by becoming more restric-
tive, increasing muscle tension), it follows that speakers
who do exhibit communicative anxiety would benefit from
desensitization procedures in therapy.

Other Considerations

Jackson et al. (2016) highlighted several considerations

related to the use of RQA applied to speech production
(e.g., a priori parameter selection, assumptions regarding
time series cyclicity, and dimensionality). Three additional
considerations are made here. First, differences in language
ability between AWS and AWNS may have contributed
to differences in speech variability. Language abilities were
estimated using the EOWPVT-3, and although the differ-
ence between AWS and AWNS was not statistically signifi-
cant (though the mean AWNS score was greater than that
of AWS), subtle differences in language ability may have
gone undetected. Thus, it cannot be ruled out that subtle
language differences between the two groups may have
differentially affected speech variability.

Second, the results may also have been influenced

by prior therapy experience. It is likely that for some of the
AWS, the use of speaking strategies (e.g., reducing rate,
easily transitioning between gestures) affected variability,
determinism, and/or stability measures. In addition, although
therapy history was included in Table 1, it was not included
as a factor in any of the statistical models because it was
too varied and too dependent on specific therapists providing
the treatment. A strong clinical argument can also be made
that self-learned strategies (i.e., those not learned in therapy)
are just as—if not more—impactful on speech kinematics.
For example, many AWS who first enroll in therapy report
using strategies such as slowing down, taking a breath,
thinking about what words to use, and so on. It is undeniable
that these kinds of strategies will affect across- and within-
sentence measures. This is an important issue and should be
explored in future work.

Third, data were collected in a controlled laboratory
(i.e., unnaturalistic) environment. That is, participants were
required to read relatively simple sentences from a monitor

in the confines of a laboratory. Because stuttering is a dis-
order that primarily manifests in meaningful communicative
exchanges, there may be concern related to how generaliz-
able the current results are. The inclusion of an audience was
meant to approximate a social environment, but it was
intentionally noninteractive. Furthermore, the purpose of
the study was to quantify and investigate subtle speech dif-
ferences between AWS and AWNS. Thus, although this
study may lack ecological validity, the controlled nature
of the approach revealed speech differences that may not
have been evident if data were collected in more naturalistic
communicative contexts. That said, a goal of future research
is to use RQA in more ecologically valid environments.

Conclusions

This study investigated the real-time impact of
social–cognitive stress on speech motor control in AWS
and AWNS by assessing across-sentence variability and
within-sentence determinism and stability. Overall, AWS
are more variable across utterances (i.e., sentences) and
more deterministic and stable within these sentences com-
pared with AWNS. The presence of an audience contrib-
uted to greater within-sentence determinism and stability
in AWS, suggesting that AWS adopt an approach to
speaking that is more restrictive and perhaps less flexible
than that of AWNS. A subgroup of AWS who were more
susceptible to experiencing anxiety exhibited reduced
across-sentence variability when speaking in the presence
of an audience, suggesting that these AWS adopt an
approach to speaking that is different from that of AWS
who are not as affected by social–cognitive stress. Future
work should examine the impact of other stressors (e.g.,
speaking in different types of stressful situations or while
engaging in dual tasks) on both across-sentence variability
and within-sentence determinism and stability in AWS and
AWNS. The methods used in this article easily can be
applied to children to assess how variability changes across
development. Furthermore, investigators should apply RQA
to more complex speech examples (i.e., not repetitions of
simple utterances) as well as other nonspeech movements
(e.g., postural sway, head movement). Last, it will be reveal-
ing to examine correlations between kinematic (and acoustic)
and neurophysiological data using the techniques described
in this article.
