Abstract
Research involving stuttering in multilingual individuals is limited. Speech-language therapists face the challenge of treating 
a diverse client base, which includes multilingual individuals. The aim of this study was to examine the stuttering moments 
across English, Afrikaans, and German in a multilingual speaker. A single multilingual adult with a severe developmental 
stutter participated in this study. A mixed-method design was implemented. The results were perceptually analyzed, and 
interrater  reliability  was  determined.  The  results  revealed  that  the  voiceless  plosive  [k],  the  voiceless  fricative  [f],  and 
the plosive-lateral approximant cluster [kl] caused stuttering moments across the languages. More stuttering moments 
occurred on consonants as opposed to vowels. The most prominent core behavior was prolongations. Language proficiency 
plays a role in the increase of the moments of stuttering in the least proficient language. Future research on a larger sample 
size is recommended. Research on African language speaking multilingual person who stutters (PWS) should be pursued.

Introduction

Stuttering is frequently referred to as the intermittent failure 
of  the  nervous  system  in  generating  command  signals  to 
muscles whose activity must be controlled for the produc-
tion of fluent speech (Smith, Sadagopan, Walsh, & Weber-
Fox, 2010). In a multifactoral view of stuttering, perceived 
dysfluencies are considered to be external manifestations of 
underlying  interacting  factors  rather  than  isolated  occur-
rences. This notion is supported by not only acknowledging 
the  surface  behaviors  of  stuttering  but  also  considering 
emotional, linguistic, and cognitive factors and the overall 
impact  on  the  speaker’s  life  (Jackson,  Quesal,  &  Yaruss, 
2012). One percent of the world’s population, across all lan-
guages  and  cultures,  stutters  (Shenker,  2011;  Van  Borsel, 
Maes, & Foulon, 2001).

Multilingualism can be described as a continuum of com-
petence in each spoken language (Roberts & Shenker, 2007). 
The global increase in multilingualism has evoked interest in 
communication disorders among multilingual speakers. This 
has raised questions related to the effect of multilingualism 
on the fluency of speech. The heterogeneity of multilingual-
ism and the influence thereof on stuttering has been deemed 
important (Van Borsel, Sunaert, & Engelen, 2005). The indi-
vidual’s age of initial exposure to each language, the usage 

of these languages, as well as social influences are factors to 
consider (Van Borsel et al., 2005).

A paucity of research on the multilingual stuttering pop-
ulation exists as few studies focused on cross-lingual stut-
tering  analysis  (Coalson,  Pena,  &  Byrd,  2013). A  lack  of 
clinical guidelines for assessment and intervention of bilin-
gual  and  multilingual  stutterers  exists  (Van  Borsel  et  al., 
2001).  Not  having  these  intervention  guidelines  in  South 
Africa  is  problematic  as  the  majority  of  the  population  is 
either  bilingual  or  multilingual  (Kashula  &  Anthonissen, 
1995). Estimates place the incidence of stuttering in South 
Africa  at  one  to  three  percent  of  the  population  (Penn, 
1978). Few attempts have been made to study and compare 
the linguistic features of an individual’s stuttering pattern in 
the  languages  of  a  bilingual  or  multilingual  person  who 
stutters (PWS; Schäfer & Robb, 2012).

Stuttering severity may vary across the languages spoken 
by a multilingual PWS (Van Borsel & Britto Pereiria, 2005).

more likely to demonstrate different patterns of stuttering in 
each language (Van Borsel & Taillieu, 2001). The frequency, 
the nature, and the distribution of dysfluencies are subject to 
the individual’s language ability in each language, with less 
stuttering in the predominant language (Lim, Lincoln, Chan, 
& Onslow, 2008). Using a comprehensive testing sample to 
evaluate a multilingual PWS is essential (Shenker, 2011). It 
is thus necessary to evaluate language proficiency of an indi-
vidual to establish which dysfluencies are actual manifesta-
tions  of  the  stutter  and  which  are  related  to  reduced 
proficiency in that language.

In  addition  to  language  proficiency,  stuttering  patterns 
are  affected  by  word  and  sound  fears  as  well  as  phonetic 
complexity (Schäfer & Robb, 2012; Yaruss & Quesal, 2004). 
PWS  are  more  likely  to  experience  stuttering  in  specific 
speaking situations, with specific conversation partners and 
on  particular  words  or  sounds  (Shapiro,  2011).  It  can  be 
expected  that  high  pressured  speaking  situations,  with  an 
unknown  or  large  audience,  as  well  as  the  occurrence  of 
feared words and/or sounds will result in a higher frequency 
of stuttering (Guitar, 2014). Word fears may have a signifi-
cant  influence  on  speech  production  and  sound  fears  may 
occur when similar sounds present across languages.

Certain phonetic features and consequent phonetic com-
plexity are specific to each language. It is therefore possible 
that a multilingual PWS will stutter more in languages with 
greater  phonetic  complexity  (Schäfer  &  Robb,  2012). 
German, Afrikaans, and English are considered Germanic 
languages  (Heeringa  &  De  Wet,  2008).  Each  language, 
however, has a unique sound system and a set of phonologi-
cal  rules  for  the  combination  of  these  sounds.  Linguistic 
variables, specifically phonetic complexity, play an impor-
tant role in the influence on speech. English and German for 
example differ in syllable structure and phonology (Bernthal 
& Bankson, 2004) with German containing a greater num-
ber  of  consonants  and  more  frequent  use  of  glottal  stops 
(Crystal,  2003;  Wiese,  1996).  German  vowels  generally 
have a stronger onset compared with English with a glottal 
stop commonly produced before the onset of a vowel, thus 
increasing  the  complexity  (Schäfer  &  Robb,  2012). 
Increased  frequency  of  stuttering  in  German  when  com-
pared with English can be attributed to the greater phonetic 
complexity  of  German  (Dworzynski  &  Howell,  2004; 
Schäfer & Robb, 2012).

In contrast to Afrikaans and German, the sound system 
of  English  includes  voiced  and  voiceless  dental  fricatives 
such as [ɵ] and alveolar approximants such as [ɹ] (Niesler, 
Louw,  &  Roux,  2005). Afrikaans  and  English  diphthongs 
are similar, but no diphthongs are shared between the two 
languages (Niesler et al., 2005). This is due to the use of lax 
vowels  in  English  which  are  characteristically  shorter, 
lower, and slightly more centralized than the corresponding 
tense vowels. Lax vowels occur repeatedly in English but 
not in Afrikaans (Ladefoged, 1975).

Cluster  effects  are  significant  in  providing  information 
on the timing and sequencing of speech gestures (Shaiman, 
2001). Consonant clusters, specifically at word-initial posi-
tion, are likely to increase the chance of stuttering (Howell, 
Au-Yeung, & Sackin, 2000). Consonants that emerge later 
in a child’s development continue to be difficult into adult-
hood and as a result words with these consonants may be 
avoided  (Locke,  1983).  Avoidance  may  therefore  be 
ascribed  to  phonetic  complexity  as  well  as  sound  fears 
developing over time and may have an impact on the over-
all  quality  of  life  (Yaruss  &  Quesal,  2004).  Consonant 
sounds, being phonetically more complex, are more often 
stuttered on than vowels (Taylor, 1966). Phonetic complex-
ity, however, is unlikely the primary and/or only determi-
nant of stuttering frequency in multilingual speakers.

The  need  for  further  studies  on  multilingual  PWS  has 
been  established 
(Van  Borsel,  Meirlaen,  Achten, 
Vingerhoets,  &  Santens,  2009).  Studies  that  investigate 
stuttering in English and Afrikaans are scarce and if found 
are outdated (Jankelowitz & Bortz, 1996), whereas studies 
comparing stuttering in English and German (Dworzynski, 
Howell, & Natke, 2003; Schäfer & Robb, 2012) are more 
abundant and recent. The investigation, however, of a mul-
tilingual PWS proficient in Afrikaans, English, and German 
remains  an  understudied  area. With  this  in  mind,  the  pur-
pose of the present study is to determine which sounds are 
language-independent  and  cause  errors  across  these  lan-
guages, and to determine which sound errors are specific to 
each language.

One  may  assume  that  a  multilingual  PWS  will  present 
with  increased  dysfluency  on  consonants,  specifically 
voiceless fricatives and plosives, due to increased phonetic 
complexity (Van Borsel et al., 2005). Consonant clusters are 
also predicted to be problematic sounds in the participant’s 
production  across  all  three  of  the  languages. As  develop-
mental  stuttering  presents  more  prominently  at  the  begin-
ning of a word, it is expected that this pattern will be found 
consistently  across  all  three  languages  along  with  associ-
ated anxiety and secondary symptoms which are character-
istic  of  this  type  of  stuttering  (Büchel  &  Sommer,  2004; 
Natke, Grosser, Sandrieser, & Kalveram, 2002). Finally, it 
is hypothesized that the individual in the present study will 
stutter  more  frequently  in  the  language  which  he  is  least 
proficient in. It is therefore reasonable to motivate further 
studies that focus on multilingual speakers, specifically in 
South Africa where numerous languages are spoken.

Method

Aim

The aim of this study is to describe the core behaviors and 
to  identify  which  sounds  errors  occur  within  and  across 
English, Afrikaans, and German in a multilingual PWS.

Research Design

The present study used a mixed-method design, comprising 
both  qualitative  and  quantitative  methods.  Both  indepen-
dent  and  dependent  variables  were  included  in  the  study. 
Independent variables (the three languages) were manipu-
lated by changing the contexts and pressure of the tasks to 
bring about change in the dependent variables (speech char-
acteristics). A single case study was utilized to explore the 
nature and frequency of stuttering across three languages in 
an individual.

Participant

The participant was chosen based on the following criteria: 
The participant had to be a multilingual adult with a severe 
developmental  stuttering  pattern,  but  with  normal  oral-
facial  structures  and  functioning.  The  stuttering  severity 
index (SSI-4; Riley, 2009) was used to determine the fre-
quency, duration, and severity of stuttering. The participant 
was a 43-year-old male, diagnosed with a severe advanced 
stuttering  pattern  (SSI-4,  percentile  rank  =  85).  Severe 
facial grimaces (jaw jerking and tongue protruding) as well 
as  foot  tapping  accompanied  the  stuttering  moments. The 
onset of stuttering was at an early age and the participant 
had been receiving intermittent speech therapy since school-
going  age.  Since  then,  the  participant  obtained  a  tertiary 
engineering diploma. The participant spoke three languages 
with  varied  proficiency.  He  reported  that  Afrikaans  and 
German were languages spoken at home but indicated that 
Afrikaans was his language of preference. English was the 
participant’s  vocational  language  and  German  was  his 
hereditary language, which he was exposed to in family and 
religious contexts.

Material and Apparatus

An assessment protocol for the evaluation of speech in all 
three  languages—English,  Afrikaans,  and  German—was 
utilized. The protocol included a word list consisting of 50 
words of equal difficulty, a phonetically balanced reading 
passage (three versions of the text “The North Wind and the 
Sun” from Roach, 2004), topic discussion and a telephone 
conversation with an unknown speaker. The aim of the pro-
tocol was to elicit suitable speech samples in both pressured 
and less stressful situations.

An Olympus digital recorder, Model DM-550, was used 
to  record  high-quality  speech.  The  audio  recorder  was 
placed on a surface anterior to the participant. A Samsung 
VP Mx10A digital camera was positioned to capture a fron-
tal  view  of  the  participant’s  face  and  chest.  This  enabled 
visual  interpretation  of  the  behavioral  aspects  associated 
with the moments of stuttering.

Procedures

Prior  to  data  collection,  ethical  clearance  was  obtained 
from the Research and Ethics Committee of the Department 
of Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology, University 
of  Pretoria.  The  participant  was  informed  of  the  purpose 
and procedures of this study and agreed to participate. He 
also  gave  permission  to  access  background  information 
from his file.

Data  collection  was  completed  within  one  sitting  and 
recording  conditions  were  controlled  to  support  validity. 
The  recordings  took  place  in  a  soundproof  room,  in  the 
Department of Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology 
at  the  University  of  Pretoria.  The  recording  duration  was 
approximately 3 hr with a 15-min break allowed between 
the testing in each language.

The participant was interviewed in English to gain addi-
tional background information. Representative speech sam-
ples were then collected in different speaking situations in 
each language. These included speaking face to face with 
the researchers about a familiar topic, a telephone conversa-
tion with an anonymous speaker, the reading of a phoneti-
cally balanced reading passage, and the reading of a word 
list of equal complexity. The order of these tasks was ran-
domized in each language to reduce, as far as possible, any 
carryover or learned effects that can manipulate stuttering 
behavior throughout recordings (Hall & Evans, 2004). All 
the  speech  samples  were  video-  and  audio-recorded  for 
optimal and repeated analysis.

Data Analysis

Perceptual analysis was conducted of the sounds on which 
the moment of stuttering occurred across all three languages. 
The core behaviors of stuttering (blocks, repetitions, or pro-
longations) were analyzed. Consensus was reached among 
multiple raters on reviewing the recorded samples.

Descriptive  statistics  were  used  to  determine  the  fre-
quency  and  nature  of  stuttering  in  each  of  the  languages. 
The sounds on which dysfluencies occurred were phoneti-
cally transcribed using the International Phonetic Alphabet.

Results

Across the three languages, a combined total of 60 stutter-
ing moments, 16 (27%) in Afrikaans, 16 (27%) in English, 
and 28 (46%) in German were identified from the word lists 
and the reading passages. Core stuttering behaviors across 
the  languages  consisted  of  27  (45%)  prolongations,  19 
(32%) repetitions, and 14 (23%) blocks (see Figure 1).

The nature and frequency of stuttering moments as well 
as  the  errors  sounds  across  the  languages  are  depicted  in

[f]  had  the  highest  occurrence  across  the  three  languages 
and  resulted  in  repetitions  in Afrikaans  and  German,  and 
prolongations  in  English,  Afrikaans,  and  German.  In 
Afrikaans  and  German,  the  voiceless  plosive  [k]  and  plo-
sive-lateral  approximant  cluster  [kl]  presented  as  a  block, 
while in English, these sounds presented as a block and a 
repetition.

Discussion

The  most  prominent  core  behavior,  across  the  three  lan-
guages,  exhibited  by  the  participant  was  prolongations. 
Similar  findings  have  been  reported  in  the  past  (Guitar, 
2014). The  participant  presented  with  a  higher  number  of 
dysfluencies on words beginning with consonants opposed 
to those beginning with vowel sounds. These findings are in 
agreement  with  previous  research  (Dworzynski  et  al., 
2003).  It  can  therefore  be  concluded  that  vowel  sounds 
were less difficult for the participant to produce across all 
three of the studied languages.

In Afrikaans and German, the majority of prolongations 
occurred on fricatives and fricative clusters. In English, how-
ever,  prolongations  occurred  on  a  variety  of  single  sounds 
classified  according  to  manner  of  air  stream  release.  The 
commonly occurring core stuttering behavior in English was 
blocks.  Plosives,  plosive-lateral  approximant  clusters,  and 
vowel monophthongs resulted in blocks across all three lan-
guages.  More  specifically,  the  plosive-lateral  approximant 
cluster  [kl],  the  voiceless  plosive  [k],  and  long  vowel 
monophthongs  caused  the  majority  of  blocks  in Afrikaans, 
English, and German. Fricatives and plosives gave rise to the 
majority  of  repetitions  in  all  three  languages.  In Afrikaans 
and German, other sounds such as trills, a nasal, and vowels 
also resulted in repetitions, though to a lesser degree. A frica-
tive-trill  cluster  led  to  repetitions  in  both  Afrikaans  and 
German. This could be because of the production of the trill 
that requires a more complex motor plan to execute the intri-
cate  apico-alveolar  tap-release  articulation  (Ladefoged  & 
Maddieson, 1996; Van Wyk, 1979). This occurrence was not 
noted in English due to the fact that the trill [r] is not present 
in the phoneme inventory of Standard South African English 
(Ladefoged & Maddieson, 1996). All repetitions in English 
occurred on plosive sounds. Of the consonants stuttered on, 
fricatives had the highest frequency of stuttering across the 
languages. Previous research also found that fricatives were 
produced with greater difficulty in adult PWS (Dworzynski 
& Howell, 2004). Plosives also resulted in a number of stut-
tering moments, however, to a lesser degree than fricatives. 
Both voiceless fricatives and plosives were more difficult to 
produce than voiced fricatives in all three languages. These 
results are in agreement with findings reported by Van Borsel 
et al. (2005).

In English, it was found that vowels and plosives resulted 
in the majority of dysfluencies. In Afrikaans and German,

each and across the language.

in  Afrikaans  and  German,  whereas  in  English  blocks 
occurred most frequently.

In Afrikaans, 81% of the 16 stuttering moments occurred 
on  consonant  sounds,  while  only  19%  of  the  stuttering 
moments occurred on vowel sounds. A total of 25% of stut-
tering  moments  occurred  on  the  voiceless  fricative  [x]  in 
isolation and in clusters. More specifically, the most com-
mon  consonant  cluster  found  to  be  stuttered  on  was  [xr], 
presenting as a repetition and prolongations. The voiceless 
plosive [k], in isolation and clusters, resulted in a repetition 
and  a  block.  Two  of  the  three  stuttering  moments  that 
occurred  on  vowels,  presented  as  blocks,  while  the  other 
was a repetition. More prolongations were noted, whereas 
similar distribution of blocks and repetitions were identified 
in the production of single sounds.

The  error  pattern  in  English  consisted  of  16  stuttering 
moments  in  total.  Of  these  stuttering  moments,  75% 
occurred  on  consonant  sounds  and  the  remaining  25% 
occurred on vowels. Stuttering moments on  single conso-
nants and consonant clusters were equally distributed. The 
voiceless plosive [k] as a single consonant and in a cluster 
resulted  in  more  frequent  instances  of  stuttering,  namely, 
repetitions  and  blocks.  Vowels  predominantly  resulted  in 
blocks, while only one prolongation occurred.

Of the 28 moments of stuttering that were recorded from 
the  German  productions,  only  11%  occurred  on  vowel 
sounds, while 89% occurred on consonant sounds. Of the 
consonant sounds stuttered on, 24% were in clusters, while 
the majority at 76% were single consonants. The most com-
mon German single consonants resulting in stuttered speech 
were  the  fricatives  [z]  and  [f]. The  voiceless  fricative  [∫], 
however, as a single consonant and in clusters has the high-
est frequency of occurrence. Of the stuttering moments on 
consonants,  prolongations  were  predominant.  One  block 
occurred on the vowel [i:], whereas the diphthong [aʊ] and 
vowel [a] resulted in repetitions.

The sounds that resulted in dysfluency in all three lan-
guages  were  the  voiceless  plosive  [k],  the  plosive-lateral 
approximant cluster [kl], and the voiceless fricative [f]. The

however, fricatives mostly led to dysfluencies. English was 
the  only  language  not  to  have  moments  of  dysfluency  on 
nasal sounds [m] and [n], while in Afrikaans [n] as a single 
sound and in a cluster was stuttered on. In German, both [m] 
and [n] resulted in dysfluency. The study revealed that the 
voiceless  plosive  sound  [k],  the  voiceless  plosive-lateral 
approximant cluster [kl] as well as the voiceless fricative [f] 
gave rise to the highest number of stuttering moments in all 
three languages.

Heterorganic  consonant  clusters,  such  as  [kl]  and  [∫r], 
were  more  difficult  to  produce  (Huinck,  van  Lieshout, 
Peters,  &  Hulstijn,  2004).  Although  the  relationship 
between  production  and  consonant  cluster  complexity  is 

unclear,  it  could  be  argued  that  the  realization  of  heteror-
ganic transitions is more complex. The production of such a 
cluster would require the coordination of different articula-
tors  with  different  inherent  mechanical  and  physiological 
properties.  Accomplishing  such  an  action  simultaneously 
might  be  more  difficult  than  doing  one  after  the  other 
(Huinck et al., 2004).

Determining  the  language  proficiency  of  a  multilingual 
speaker in each of the languages he or she speaks to distinguish 
stuttering moments from errors related to poor language profi-
ciency is necessary (Van Borsel & Taillieu, 2001). The partici-
pant in the present study was more proficient in Afrikaans and 
English,  and  therefore  presented  with  a  lower  frequency  of

stuttering in these languages. In contrast, the participant pre-
sented with more frequent moments of stuttering in German, 
the language he reports to be least proficient in. Similar find-
ings were reported where reduced proficiency in a language 
resulted in an increase in frequency of stuttering (Lim et al., 
2008; Van Borsel et al., 2001; Van Borsel et al., 2005). This can 
be  accounted  for  by  the  greater  cognitive  and  linguistic 
demands associated with the use of the less proficient language 
which  places  additional  strain  on  the  speech  motor  system, 
thus  increasing  the  frequency  of  speech  dysfluencies  in  that 
language (Lee, Robb, Ormand, & Blomgren, 2014).

Although the concept of language proficiency is difficult to 
define, it is considered to be a measure of a person’s command 
of grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation (Bialystok, 2001; 
Roberts & Shenker, 2007; Scharff-Rethfeldt, 2005). Rating of 
language proficiency in the present study was based on the 
participant’s self-ratings, his frequency of language use, and 
the specific domains of language use. Speech motor systems 
of  PWS  are  therefore  susceptible  to  the  linguistic  demands 
required to produce more complex utterances. Au-Yeng and 
Howell (2002) found that the nature of a speech production, 
the speech motor processes as well as the planning processes 
can overload a speech production system and cause dysflu-
ency (Au-Yeng & Howell, 2002). In addition to these aspects, 
sound  fears  may  also  influence  the  occurrence  of  stuttering 
moments  across  the  languages.  It  can  be  expected  that  the 
presence  of  more  complex  sounds  may  lead  to  sound  fears 
which will result in a higher frequency of stuttering (Guitar, 
2014). A high frequency of dysfluency on the consonant clus-
ter [kl] may therefore be due to sound fears. In contrast, sound 
fears may also result in avoidance behaviors, which in turn 
affect  the  frequency  of  the  stuttering  moments. This  occur-
rence  should  be  explored  in  multilingual  PWS.  In  addition, 
the effect of situational fears should also be considered.

The study made use of a single case to explore the nature 
and frequency of stuttering across three languages in a mul-
tilingual PWS. As the unit of study is singular, the results 
obtained  cannot  be  generalized  to  the  larger  multilingual 
stuttering population and must be viewed within context of 
the  single  participant.  The  inclusion  of  a  larger  group  of 
participants  is  recommended  to  obtain  an  adequate  repre-
sentation of multilingual PWS, which can be generalized to 
the population. Both the word list and the reading passage 
of the present study were limited in size. It is therefore rec-
ommended that larger speech samples should be collected 
for analysis. Finally, a similar study investigating the stut-
tering  pattern  across  three  or  more  South African  indige-
nous languages is recommended as these languages contain 
complex productions, such as clicks.

Conclusion

The  study  aimed  to  determine  and  compare  the  sounds 
affecting the moments of stuttering across the languages of 

Afrikaans, English, and German in a multilingual individ-
ual. The consonant sounds that presented with the greatest 
difficulty in all three languages were voiceless plosives and 
voiceless  fricatives,  namely,  the  plosive  [k],  the  plosive-
lateral approximant cluster [kl], and the fricative [f]. More 
moments of stuttering occurred on words starting with con-
sonant sounds as opposed to vowel sounds. The most prom-
inent  core  behavior,  across  the  three  languages,  was 
prolongations. The language which presented with the high-
est frequency of stuttered moments was German. This was 
also the language in which the participant was least profi-
cient.  Future  research  on  a  larger  sample  size  is  recom-
mended. In addition, research on African language speaking 
multilingual PWS should be pursued.
