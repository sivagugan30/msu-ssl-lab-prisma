Purpose:  This  case  study  describes  treatment  recommendations  for  young  chil-
dren  who  stutter  who  present  with  articulation  (i.e.,  motor-based)  errors  impact-
ing  the  child’s  ability  or  desire  to  communicate.  Recommendations  for  children 
who  stutter  with  speech  sound  disorders  have  previously  focused  on  phonolo-
gical  (e.g.,  language-based)  errors;  however,  remediation  of  motor-based  errors 
require  a  more  direct  treatment  approach. 
Method:  The  case  is  a  3-year-old  female  who  stutters  with  concomitant  latera-
lized  productions  of  sibilants,  including  /s/  and  /z/.  A  literature  review  was  con-
ducted  when  developing  the  treatment  plan  to  identify  treatment  elements  that 
might  best  support  the  child’s  development  of  her  speech  sound  skills  and 
treatment  progress  data  are

reported  across  8  months  of  treatment. 
Results:  As  a  result  of  the  provided  motor-based  approach  with  modifications 
to  facilitate  a  positive  speaking  environment,  the  child  improved  her  production 
of  sibilants  at  the  word  level  from  69%  occurrence  of  lateralizations  to  9%,  her 
improved,  and  her  stuttering  severity 
attitudes  about  her  communication 
remained  the  same. 
Conclusion:  A  motor-based  treatment  plan  to  improve  speech  sound  accuracy 
is  appropriate  when  working  with  a  child  who  stutters  with  articulation  errors.

are  discussed  to  help  clinicians  tailor  treatment  plans  to  the  needs  of  individual 
children.

Young  children  who  stutter  with  concomitant  speech 
sound  disorders  are  often  discussed  in  the  literature,  but 
only  minimal  empirical  evidence  has  been  provided  rela-
tive 
(e.g.,  Conture  et  al.,  1993; 
Unicomb  et  al.,  2017).  The  need  for  treatment  recommen-
dations  is  important  given  that  the  prevalence  of  children 
who  stutter  with  a  concomitant  speech-sound  disorder  has 
been  estimated  to  be  as  high  as  46%  (Blood  et  al.,  2003) 
but  with  other  more  moderate  estimates  at  16%  and  28%

The  purpose  of  this  clinical 

focus  article  was  to 
describe  an  evidence-based  treatment  approach  provided 
to  a  young  child  who  stutters,  who  produced  motor-based 
lateralization  errors.  Lateralized  errors  are  characterized 
by  an  escape  of  airflow  over  the  sides  of  the  tongue, 
rather  than  centrally  out  of  the  mouth,  during  fricative 
and  affricate  sounds  (i.e.,  /s/,  /ʃ/,  or  /tʃ/).  McLeod  et  al. 
(2013)  estimated  the  prevalence  of  lateralization  errors  in 
4-year-olds 
from  a 
review  of  the  literature  on  remediating  lateralization  errors 
in  children  who  do  and  do  not  stutter  and  describe  our 
application  of  these  findings  to  a  3-year-old  child  who 
stutters  for  the  purposes  of  providing  recommendations 
and  options  for  speech-language  pathologists  (SLPs)  treat-
ing  children  who  stutter  with  concomitant  articulation  dis-
orders.  Although

Case  Background 

Alexa  was  a  3-year,  3-month-old  girl,  who  came  to 
participate  in  a  research  study  at  a  local  university  investi-
gating  preschool-age  children  who 
stutter.  Alexa  was 
accompanied  by  her  mother,  Jenni,  who  completed  a  case 
intake  form  and  interview.  Jenni  reported  that  Alexa  had 
for  approximately  9  months.  Since  the 
been  stuttering 
onset  of  stuttering  in  which  Alexa’s  stuttering  was  “very 
severe,”  her  stuttering  had  decreased 
in  frequency  and 
duration,  but  she  still  stuttered  on  occasion.  Jenni  shared 
there  was  a  positive  family  history  of  persistent  stuttering 
on  her  side  of  the  family  that 
impacted  nearly  all  the 
males.  She  reported  that  due  to  stuttering  being  common 
in  her  family,  she  was  not  surprised  or  concerned  that  her 
daughter  stuttered.  At  study  entry,  no  other  concerns  were 
reported.  However,  Jenni  did  mention  that  Alexa  would 
become  upset  when  adults 
to  correct  her  speech 
errors,  tended  to  have  “perfectionistic  tendencies”  like  her 
father,  and  was  “extremely  shy”  and  rarely  spoke  to  new

children  or  adults.  Jenni  also  shared  that  Alexa  enjoys 
books  and  playing  with  her  younger  brother. 

Assessment 

Alexa  participated  in  an  initial  comprehensive  evalu-
ation  conducted  by  the  university  research  team.  Because 
of  safety  protocol  due  to  coronavirus  disease  2019,  Alexa 
wore  a  mask  during  all  testing.  Prior  to  the  evaluation, 
Jenni  reiterated  that  Alexa  is  “extremely  shy”  and  may 
not  talk  to  the  clinicians.  Relatedly,  Alexa  did  not  con-
verse  with  the  clinician  other  than  during  standardized 
assessments.  A  speech  sample  was  not  obtained  to  evalu-
ate  her  stuttering  due  to  her  saying  fewer  than  10  words 
as  she  and  the  clinician  engaged  with  toys.  However,  dur-
interaction  with  toys,  she  often  smiled, 
ing  the  15-min 
interacted  with  the  toys,  and  made  eye  contact  with  the 
clinician.  Language  testing  using  the  Clinical  Evaluation 
of  Language  Fundamentals  Preschool–Third  Edition 
(CELF  Preschool-3;  Wiig  et  al.,  2020)  revealed  high-
average  to  above-average  expressive  (standard  score:  120) 
and  receptive  (standard  score:  114) 
language  skills.  The 
clinician  rated  Alexa’s  intelligibility  as  “2”  or  “partially 
intelligible”  using  the  Children’s  Independent  and  Rela-
scale 
tional  Phonological  Analysis 
(Baker,  2016),  which  ranges  from  1  (completely  intelligibil-
ity ) to 5 (completely  unintelligible).  Alexa  received  a  stan-
dard  score  of  94  on  the  Arizona  Articulation  and  Phonol-
(Fudala  &  Stegall,  2017).  Errors  mostly

reflected  fronting  and  cluster  reduction  of  s-blends.  Based 
on  KiddyCAT  Communication  Attitude  Test  for  Preschool 
and  Kindergarten  Children  Who  Stutter  (Vanryckeghem  & 
Brutten,  2007),  an  assessment  of  a  child’s  attitudes  toward 
communication  and  awareness  of  communicative  chal-
lenges,  Alexa  received  a  score  of  4  (out  of  12),  indicating 
elevated  awareness  of  her  difficulties  talking.  Specifically, 
she  reported  that  talking  is  difficult/hard,  that  people  need 
to  help  her  talk,  that  words  are  hard  for  her  to  say,  and 
that  she  does  not  think  she  talks  right.

During  the  check-in  3  months  into  study  participa-
tion,  when  Alexa  was  3  years  and  6  months  old,  Jenni 
reported  concerns  about  Alexa’s  willingness  to  communi-
cate  with  other  children  in  her  preschool  classroom  and 
attributed  these  concerns  to  Alexa’s  intelligibility  and  not

Notably,  Alexa  was  no  longer  required  to  wear  a  mask  as 
she  was  during  the  initial  evaluation.  Lateralized  produc-

considered  “partially  intelligible”  and  her  percent  consonant 
correct  was  78%.  Alexa  stuttered  on  approximately  1%  of 
the  words  within  the  sample,  but  it  is  important  to  note 
that  the  speech  sample  was  a  monologue  in  which  Alexa 
told  her  mom  a  story  she  had  made  up.  It  is  possible  that 
had  questions  been  posed,  her  stuttering  frequency  would 
have  increased.  Relatedly,  Jenni  reported  that  she  contin-
ued  to  hear  stuttering  on  occasion.  The  oral  mechanism 
exam  revealed  jaw  sliding  and  an  asymmetrical  smile.

lateralized  productions  being  an  atypical 
developmental  error  requiring  remediation  (Smit  et  al., 
1990)  and  parental  concerns 
these  speech  sound 
errors  were  impacting  Alexa’s  willingness  to  communicate 
with  others,  treatment  was  warranted.  Further,  her  odds 
of  developing  persistent  stuttering  were  evaluated  based 
on  established  prognostic  factors,  which  include  a  family 
history  of  persistent  stuttering,  low  speech  sound  produc-
tion  skills, 
language  skills, 
males,  and  higher  percentages  of  stuttering-like  disfluen-
cies  (Singer  et  al.,  2020).  Based  on  these  factors,  Alexa 
was  considered  to  be  at  elevated  risk  to  persist  given  her 
family  history  of  persistent  stuttering,  stuttering  duration 
of  over  12  months,  and 
impaired  speech-sound  skills. 
Given  her  odds  to  persist  and  her  continued  stuttering, 
her  stuttering  would  be  important  to  consider  relative  to 
her  speech  sound  treatment.

concomitant  speech-sound  disorders,  they  completed  a  sys-
tematic  review  with  a  focus  on  articulation  disorders  as 
opposed  to  phonological  disorders.  Differentiating  these 
two  types  of  speech  sound  disorders  is  important  because 
language-based  approaches  are  appropriate  for  phonolo-
gical  errors,  whereas  motor-based  approaches  are  appro-
priate  for  articulation  errors.  In  addition,  lateral  lisps,  one 
type  of  articulation  error,  are  considered  nondevelopmen-
tal  and  to  not  spontaneously  improve  (Smit  et  al.,  1990). 
A  recent  study  by  Overby  et  al.  (2022)  found  that  over 
96%  of  the  SLP  who  completed  their  survey  identified  that 
lateral  lisps  require  direct  remediation. 

Despite  this  important  distinction,  articulation  and 
phonological  disorders  are  often  combined  within  the  stut-
tering 
literature  (e.g.,  Arndt  &  Healey,  2001;  Unicomb 
et  al.,  2020).  Blood  et  al.  (2003)  did  differentiate  these  two 
disorders  and  found  that  SLPs  reported  that  more  children 
who  stutter  on  their  caseload  present  with  articulation  dis-
orders  than  phonological  disorders.  Specifically,  33.5%  of 
the  children  who  stutter  with  a  concomitant  speech  disor-
der  were  reported  as  having  an  articulation  disorder  com-
pared  to  12.5%  having  a  phonological  disorder.  These 
findings  highlight 
evidence- and 
practice-based  recommendations  for  working  with  children 
who  stutter  with  concomitant  articulation  disorders.  Effi-
cacious  treatments  relative  to  speech  sound  disorders  are 
warranted  for  children  who  stutter,  not  only  due  to  their 
impact  on  speech  intelligibility  and  the  child’s  communica-
tion  but  also  due  to  the  influence  speech  sound  skills  may 
have  on  stuttering  persistence  (e.g.,  Spencer  &  Weber-Fox, 
2014;  Walsh  et  al.,  2021).

Findings  presented  in  Conture  et  al.  (1993)  highlight 
the 
linguistic-based 
limitations  of  using  an 
approach  for  motor-based  errors.  Three  of  the  eight  chil-
dren  who  stutter  in  this  study  exhibited  a  speech  sound 
disorder  that  included  lateralized  productions  in  addition 
to  other  speech  sound  errors.  These  three  children  were 
given  the  same  indirect,  group  treatment  as  the  remaining 
five  children  with  phonologically  based  disorders.  Treat-
ment  included  clinician  modeling  of  accurate  speech  sound 
productions  at  a  slow–normal  rate  and  increased  opportu-
nities  for  the  child  to  practice  over  time.  Corrective  feed-
information  to  correct  articulatory  placement, 
back,  or 
and  acknowledgement  of  incorrect  productions  were  not 
provided.  Less  improvement  was  observed  for  the  laterali-
zation  errors  than  the  phonologically  based  errors.  For 
example,  the  phonological  process  of  fronting  showed  an 
average  75%  decrease  in  occurrence,  whereas  lisps  showed 
an  average  of  a  2%  decrease  in  occurrence.  These  data 
suggest  that  although  language-based  indirect  approaches 
may  be  facilitative  for  phonological  errors,  they  may  not 
be  as  effective  for  motor-based  articulation  errors.

motor-based  treatment  approach  helps  the  client  obtain 
new  motor  patterns  for  proper  articulatory  placement.  A

within  different  word  positions  (prevocalic,  intervocalic,  and 
postvocalic),  and  production  of  words  with  the  target  sound

for  /s/.

Use  of  a  motor-based  approach  was  described  in  the 
work  of  Unicomb  et  al.  (2017).  In  this  study,  all  partici-
pating  children  were  treated  concurrently  for  both  stutter-
ing  and  speech  sound  deficits.  The  four  children  in  this

study  made  significant  improvements  with  direct  therapy 
in  both  stuttering  and  speech  sound  disorder  when  given 
personalized  treatment  plans.  The  three  children  with  lin-
language-based 
guistically  based  errors  were  provided  a 
approach,  and  the  child  with  a 
lisp  received  a  motor-
based  treatment  plan.  The  authors  reported  that  “tradi-
tional  articulation  therapy”  (p.  255)  was  provided.  Nota-
bly,  the  remediation  of  the  three  children  with  language-
based  errors  was  faster  than  the  single  child  with  a  motor-
based  error  (i.e., 
lisp).  The  treatment  outcomes 
from  this  study  indicate  that  improvement  along  both  dis-
orders  may  improve;  however,  due  to  the  nature  of  motor-
ically  based  deficits,  more  time  may  be  needed  to  fully 
remediate  errors.  Additionally, 
in  their  follow-up  study 
(Unicomb  et  al.,  2022),  only  the  child  with  the  motorically 
based  speech  sound  disorder  exhibited  relapse  relative  to

In  addition  to  considering  whether  a  language- or 
motor-based  approach  is  most  appropriate  for  the  child, 
several  additional  treatment  considerations  have  been  rec-
ommended  to  limit  the  impact  the  speech  sound  treatment 
may  have  on  the  child’s  stuttering  and  thoughts  about 
their  communication.  To  reduce  the  potential  exacerbation 
of  stuttering,  the  clinician  can  modify  their  own  interac-
tions  to  provide  a  more  positive  speaking  environment 
within  the  therapy  room,  which  may  be  classified  as  indi-
rect  stuttering  therapy.  The  American  Speech-Language-

hindering  to  the  child’s  communication,  and  to  prioritize 
that  (e.g.,  Logan  &  LaSalle,  2003).  When  not  targeting 
specific  sounds,  Hall  et  al.  (2022)  suggested  it  is  important 
for  the  clinician  to  focus  on  what  the  child  is  communicat-
ing  and  not  necessarily  how  they  are  communicating. 

The  clinician  can  also  help  boost  the  child’s  confi-
dence  by  providing  specific  praise  during 
the  sessions 
(“You  just  picked  up  all  the  cards.  You  are  so  helpful”), 
which  is  highlighted  in  the  Palin  Parent–Child  Interaction 
Therapy  program  (Kelman  &  Nicholas,  2020).  Avoiding 
overt  corrections  is  often  recommended  relative  to  phonol-
ogical  treatment  (e.g.,  Conture  et  al.,  1993;  Wolk,  1998), 
and  whereas  this 
is  not  applicable  to  articulation  treat-
ment, 
the  clinician  can  provide  a  supportive  balance 
between  positive  and  corrective  feedback,  making  sure  to 
point  out  not  only  when  the  child  was  incorrect  but  also 
when  the  child  is  correct. 

Evidence:  Speech  Sound  Disorders 

Due  to  limited  treatment  recommendations  relative 
to  motor-based  speech  errors  within  the  stuttering  litera-
ture,  we  also  explored  recommendations  that  were  not 
specifically  made  for  children  who  stutter.  The  following 
literature  review  has  been  organized  by  components  we 
think  are  particularly  important  to  consider  when  working 
with  children  who  stutter  and  have  motor-based  articula-
tion  errors,  like  Alexa. 

Jaw  Placement  Tools 

Marshalla  (2011)  presented  findings  favoring  tradi-
therapy  approaches  and  provided  a 
tional  articulation 
review  of  tools  used  by  Van  Riper  and  other  articulation 
experts.  Marshalla  highlighted  that  the  use  of  tools  and 
manipulations,  such  as  a  whistle  for  lip  rounding,  may  be 
fundamental  in  teaching  the  appropriate  use  of  oral  articu-
lators  when  producing  speech  sounds.  Notably,  she  identi-
fied  that  empirical  support  for  these  tools  is  still  needed. 
Specifically  for  this  case  study,  deviations  with  jaw  mis-
alignment  and  sliding  during  fricative  sounds  were  identi-
lateralized  productions. 
fied  as  contributing 
Treatment  tools,  such  as  biting  down  on  a  straw  or  using 
hands  to  manually  hold  the  jaw  in  place,  could  be  used  to 
teach  discrimination  and  awareness  of  articulatory  move-
ments.  It  is  important  to  note  that  in  light  of  developmen-
tal  speech  sound  disorders,  these  activities  are  not  found 
to  be  empirically  relevant  in  building  strength  as  the  etiol-
ogy  for  these  disorders  is  not  weakness  (such  as  dysar-
thria),  but  by  intentionally  teaching  articulatory  placement 
for  speech.  This  tactile  support  during  speech  production 
can  help  the  child  obtain  the  correct  articulatory  place-
ment,  which  provides  opportunities  for  the  clinician  to 
provide  positive  reinforcement  (e.g.,  “you  kept  everything 

to  Alexa’s 

still  there!”)  as  opposed  to  only  providing  corrective  feed-
back  (i.e.,  telling  the  child  what  they  should  do  to  correct 
their  production).  Once  these  tools  and  manipulations  are 
used  to  teach  discrimination,  the  next  step  is  to  remove 
support  of  the 
then  move 
towards  independence. 

tools  and  manipulations  to 

Use  of  Nonwords 

interdentalized 

Masterson  and  Daniels  (1991)  found  that  a  child 
with  an 
lisp  exhibited  rapid  gains  once 
nonwords  were  introduced  in  therapy.  The  child  received 
therapy  for  two  semesters  using  contrastive  approaches 
such  as  the  distinctive  features  approach  (Weiner  &  Bank-
son,  1978).  This  child  made  minimal  gains  related  to  the 
sibilant  distortion,  and  it  was  not  until  nonsense  words 
were  introduced  that  this  child  demonstrated  full  remedia-
tion  of  distortions.  This  improvement  may  be  attributed  to 
the  extinction  of  incorrect  sound  productions  and  represen-
tations  that  the  child  is  already  familiar  with  and  may  aid 
in  assisting  the  child  in  learning  a  “new  sound”  (i.e.,  the 
correct  speech  sound).  For  example,  instead  of  practicing 
/s/  in  “say,”  a  word  which  the  child  might  have  said  incor-
rectly  hundreds  of  times,  the  child  practices  /s/  in  “sih.” 
Therefore,  the  use  of  nonsense  words  may  be  beneficial  in 
facilitating  correct  articulatory  placement  to  the  unrecogniz-
able  sound  combinations.  This  might  also  be  particularly 
beneficial  when  taking  a  communication-based  approach 
with  a  child  who  stutters  because  the  emphasis  is  on  learn-
ing  a  “new”  sound  instead  of  correcting  an  “old”  sound. 

Self-Monitoring 

in 

isolation, 

Another  piece  to  aid  in  the  remediation  of  latera-
lized  productions  and  other  motor-based  errors  is  teaching 
the  child  to  self-monitor  as  investigated  by  Koegel  et  al. 
(1986).  In  this  study,  10  out  of  the  13  participants  pre-
sented  with  motor-based  articulatory  errors  (e.g.,  dentali-
zation  of  /s,  z/).  These  children  also  received  a  traditional 
articulation  approach  in  which  treatment  followed  a  hier-
archy  of  increased  linguistic  levels;  they  were  taught  the 
target  sound 
then 
increased  complexity  until  the  appropriate  production  was 
generalized  to  the  conversation.  Additionally,  the  clini-
cians  explicitly  taught  and  positively  reinforced  these  chil-
dren 
sounds  by  marking 
attempts  as  incorrect/correct  during  sessions  and  expand-
ing  to  natural  environments,  such  as  the  classroom  or  at 
home.  All  children  who  participated 
in  self-monitoring 
activities  showed  improvement  in  the  generalization  probe, 
indicating  that  the  self-monitoring  procedures  may  sup-
port  the  child’s  progress  to  generalize  their  skills  learned 
in  the  therapy  room  to  other  environments.

stuttering  treatment,  caregivers  can  request  that  their  child 
self-evaluates 
their  stuttering  after  either  stuttering-free 
speech  or  unambiguous  stuttering.  Similarly,  clinicians  can 
have  the  child  evaluate  the  accuracy  of  their  speech-sound 
productions  after  either  correct  or  incorrect  productions; 
however,  we  recommend  that  clinicians  more  often  have 
the  child  self-evaluate  after  correct  productions  to  rein-
force  to  the  child  that  they  are  doing  well  and  making 
progress. 

Short  Practice  Blocks 

the  5-min  Quick  Articulation! 

It  is  important  when  working  with  young  children 
who  stutter  to  keep  demands  within  their  communicative 
environment  low  and  to  ensure  that  the  therapist’s  support 
for  correct  articulatory  placement  does  surpass  the  child’s 
zone  of  proximal  development  (Nippold,  1990).  To  limit 
the  motoric  demands  placed  on  children  who  stutter  while 
remediating  speech  sounds,  evidence-based  research  regard-
ing  the  efficacy  of  5-min  articulation  sessions  was  explored. 
Roepke  et  al.  (2019)  conducted  a  review  of  current  research 
on 
therapy  model.  This 
model  is  a  treatment  approach  that  is  designed  to  attain  a 
high  amount  of  treatment  dosage  within  a  short  5-min  time 
period,  multiple  times  a  week.  Rather  than  the  traditional 
approach  where  a  child  receives  one  or  two  30-min  sessions 
a  week,  these  children  receive  several  (e.g.,  three  to  five) 
5-min  articulation  sessions  per  week.  Roepke  et  al.  (2019) 
found  that  these  5-min  sessions  were  more  efficient  in  treat-
ing  articulation  disorders  than  the  traditional  approach. 
Specifically,  children  who  received  Quick  Articulation!  pro-
duced  three  times  the  number  of  practice  trials  with  less 
time  spent  in  therapy  than  children  receiving  one  or  two 
30-min  sessions.  The  authors  recommended  50–70  trials  per 
5-min  session  at  least  3  times  a  week. 

Utilizing  a  brief  period  of  treatment  may  be  particu-
larly  appropriate  for  some  children  who  stutter  with  a 
concomitant  speech  sound  disorder  because  it  allows  for 
short  periods  of  drill  practice  (i.e.,  limiting  the  length  of 
time  in  which  motoric  demands  are  placed  on  the  child) 
and  time  within  the  therapy  session  to  focus  on  treatment 
of  stuttering  or  other  concerns  if  warranted.  This  strategy 
may  not  be  appropriate  for  a  child  who  may  be  vulnerable 
to  time  pressure.

child-size  table  as  Jenni  observed  from  a  separate  room. 
These  sessions  utilized  a  motor-based  approach  to  remedi-
ate  the  lateral  lisp.  Notably,  reduction  of  stuttering  was 
not  directly  targeted  as  it  was  not  found  to  be  impacting 
her  communication  or  participation.  However, 
indirect 
treatment  modifications,  such  as  the  clinician  speaking  at 
a  slow–normal  rate  of  speech  and  increasing  pause  times, 
were  implemented  to  limit  demands  that  may  exacerbate 
stuttering  and  promote  a  positive  communication  environ-
ment.  Age-appropriate  phonological  awareness  activities 
were  also  embedded  due  to  the  presence  of  articulation 
disorders  placing  a  child  at  higher  risk  for  impaired  pho-
nological  awareness  skills  and  later  reading  difficulty  (e.g., 
Farquharson,  2019;  Tambyraja  et  al.,  2020).  Following 
each  session, 
for 
the  session 
the  clinician  summarized 
Jenni  and  explained  home  programming  if  appropriate. 

Sessions  were  broken  up 

into  several  activities  to 
encourage  Alexa’s  continued  participation  and  attention. 
Drill  activities  were  alternated  with  more 
indirect  and 
reinforcing  activities  (e.g.,  tablet  computer  game  or  crafts). 
Drill  activities  were  designed  to  target  the  motor  learning 
sequences  as  described  below  and  began  by  targeting  /s/ 
before  targeting  s-blends  and  /z/. 

Auditory  Discrimination 

As  a  precursor  to  stimulability,  Alexa’s  ability  to 
auditorily  discriminate  between  accurate  and 
lateralized 
productions  of  /s/  was  assessed.  When  the  clinician  pro-
vided  examples  of  both  types  of  productions  during  the 
first  session,  Alexa  was  100%  accurate. 

Stimulability

Multiple  stimulability  strategies  were  utilized  with 
less 
invasive  strategies 
were  selected  first  to  limit  the  explicit  motor  demands  put 
on  Alexa,  which  could  exacerbate  her  stuttering.  Producing 
a  /s/  from  a  /t/  (e.g.,  a  “lazy  t”)  was  attempted  given  its 
prominence  in  the  literature  and  the  second  author’ s previ-
ous  successes  with  it;  however,  Alexa  did  not  make  any 
gains  across  several  sessions.  Similarly,  using  facilitative 
contexts,  such  as  targeting  /s/  in  words  like  “hats”  was  not 
successful.  Gains  in  stimulability  were  not  observed  until 
more  direct  shaping  strategies  were  used,  like  using  a  bite 
block  to  reduce  her  jaw  sliding.  As  the  use  of  these  blocks 
jaw  support  were  faded,  she 
and  tactile  cues  providing 
benefited  from  seeing  her  mouth  and  being  reminded  to 
keep  her  jaw  still  when  producing  /s/  within  isolation. 

Practicing  Single  Words 

As  Alexa  began  practicing  single  words  in  therapy, 
consonant-vowel  words  (e.g.,  “say, ” “see”)  were  targeted 
prior  to  consonant–vowel–consonant  words  (e.g.,  “same,” 
“seek”)  to  scaffold  the  motoric  demands  being  placed  on

the 

Alexa.  Based  on 
literature  review,  nonwords  were 
introduced.  However,  perhaps  due  to  Alexa’s  “perfection-
istic”  tendencies,  they  were  discontinued  after  one  session. 
The  nonwords  seemed  to  agitate  Alexa,  and  not  only  was 
she  less  accurate  when  producing  them  compared  to  real 
words  but  she  was  also  more  reluctant  to  participate  in 
therapy  activities  utilizing  them. 

Practicing  Short  Phrases 

Once  Alexa  reached  80%  accuracy  at  the  word  level, 
like  “I  see 
short  phrases  were  targeted.  Carrier  phrases 
_____”  and  adding  age-appropriately  adjectives  to  target 
words  (e.g.,  “stinky  sock”)  were  embedded  within  activi-
ties.  Additional  treatment  elements  were  also  embedded  in 
efforts  to  facilitate  a  positive  communication  environment 
to  promote  easier  speech: 

Facilitating  Success 

Another  important  element  of  Alexa’s  drill  practice 
was  the  incorporation  of  sounds  that  she  was  relatively 
/s/,  but 
successful  with.  Treatment  primarily 
sounds  like  /tʃ/  and  /ʃ/,  which  she  produced  more  accu-
rately,  were  occasionally  embedded  to  increase  the  number 
of  successful  trials.  These  sounds  use  similar  articulatory 
placement  as  /s/,  so  they  also  provided  relevant  practice.

Short  Practice  Blocks 

Following  principles  of  5-min  articulation,  drill 
activities  were  provided  in  several  5-min  intervals  during 
the  session.  Alexa  was  observed  to  appreciate  the  reduced 
time  and  enjoyed  pressing  the  button  to  “start”  the  timer 
and  occasionally  monitoring 
time  as  evidenced  by 
smiling  and  cheering  when  the  timer  sounded.

Bibliotherapy 

One  activity  that  was  consistent  across  sessions  was 
the  reading  of  a  book.  Jenni  shared  that  Alexa  enjoyed 
reading,  so  books  were  selected  to  target  various  skills. 
During  the  first  several  sessions,  books  were  selected  based 
on  themes  that  addressed  teacher/caregiver  concerns  (i.e., 
the  importance  of  friendships  and  being  brave).  Books  were 
also  selected  based  on  how  well  they  facilitated  phonolo-
gical  awareness  practice  (e.g.,  rhyming  and  alliteration)  and 
their  inclusion  of  targeted  speech  sounds  to  facilitate  addi-
tional  speech-sound  practice.  As  Alexa  became  more  suc-
cessful  in  producing  target  sounds,  more  time  was  spent 
including  during  the 
practicing  them  across  the  session, 
book  reading  activity.  For  example,  when  reading  Sally 
Snip  Snap’ s Party  (Holden,  2005),  Alexa  was  encouraged 
to  help  the  clinician  say  the  child’s  name,  by  saying  “Snip 
Snap”  every  time  the  clinician  said  “Sally.” 

Results 

A  probe  (Appendix)  was  developed  to  monitor  her 
progress  across  sibilants  in  the  initial  and  final  positions. 
This  probe  was  administered  every  few  months;  results  are 
provided  in  Table  2.  Compared  to  pretreatment  when  she 
lateralized  69%  of  sibilants  during  single-word  produc-
tions,  she  lateralized  43%  of  sibilants  following  approxi-
mately  3  months  of  treatment,  19%  of  sibilants  following 
6  months  of  treatment,  and  9%  following  10  months  of 
treatment.  Progress  was 
in  the  beginning,  espe-
limited 
cially  as  stimulability  was  targeted,  but  she  made  progress 
first  with  initial  /s/  before  progressing  with  s-blends  and  /z/. 
Direct  instruction  was  required  to  remediate  /z/,  because

with  its  voiceless  cognate  (e.g.,  /s/). 

In  addition  to  gains  in  lateralized  productions,  she 
began  communicating  more  openly  with  others  approxi-
mately  6  months  into  therapy.  Jenni  reported  that  Alexa 
began  talking  more  often  and  more  animatedly  to  family 
members 
(e.g.,  grandparents).  The  clinician  also  noted 
that  Alexa  shared  longer  and  more  frequent  stories  during 
the  therapy  sessions. 

responses 

Alexa’s  stuttering  remained  relatively 

low  across 
therapy,  but  moments  of  stuttering  were  observed  during 
a  few  sessions  and  occasionally  at  home  based  on  Jenni’s 
report.  When  the  clinician  noted  moments  of  stuttering, 
task  demands  were  lowered  or  a  brief  break  was  taken. 
Examples  of  lowering  task  demands  included  requesting 
instead  of  phrases.  Periods  of 
single-word 
increased  stuttering  at  home  were  fairly  brief,  and  Jenni 
remained  unconcerned.  The  KiddyCAT  was  readminis-
tered  approximately  10  months  into  therapy,  and  Alexa 
scored  1/12,  which  indicated  predominately  positive  atti-
tudes  toward  her  communication  abilities.  The  score  also 
indicated  a  positive 
improvement  compared  to  pretreat-
ment  (baseline:  4/12).  Her  only  more  negative  response 
was  that  she  did  not  think  she  talks  right.  Based  on  a  300-
word  speech  sample  collected  in  the  clinic  room,  Alexa 
was  2%  stuttering-like  disfluent.  During  this  sample,  Alexa 
talked  about  toys  she  brought  with  her  to  the  session  and 
answered  related  questions  from  the  clinician.  Her  stutter-
ing  was  characterized  by  brief  sound/syllable  repetitions 
and  whole-word  repetitions. 

Discussion 

Alexa,  a  3-year-old  girl  who  stutters,  was  evaluated 
intelligibility  and 
following  concerns  about  her  speech 
unwillingness  to  communicate  beyond  a  small  group  of 
family  and  close  friends.  Treatment  was  to  prioritize  based 
on  which  communication  challenge 
(e.g.,  stuttering  or 
speech  sound  errors)  was  found  to  impact  her  communica-
tion  most  (e.g.,  Hall  et  al.,  2022;  Logan  &  LaSalle,  2003). 
Following  direct  child  testing  and  parent  report,  the  clini-
cian  determined  that  the  remediation  of  lateralized  frica-
tive  sounds  would  improve  overall  intelligibility  and  the 
child’s  confidence  when  talking. 

Previous  recommendations  for  remediating  speech 
sound  errors  for  young  children  who  stutter  typically  have 
included  language-based  approaches,  but  Alexa’s  lateralized 
productions  necessitated  a  motor-based  approach.  To  pro-
vide  this  most  appropriate  treatment  for  the  lateralized  errors 
while  also 
limiting  motoric  and  emotional  demands  that 
could  exacerbate  stuttering,  several  treatment  modifications 

SIG 4 Fluency and Fluency Disorders

were  prioritized.  Treatment  first  targeted  sensory-perceptual 
training  (e.g.,  auditory  discrimination)  in  a  hierarchical  fash-
ion  to  facilitate  success  and  consider  the  child’ s zone of  prox-
imal  development.  For  example,  the  articulatory  placement 
of  a  single  sound  was  targeted  prior  to  single-word  produc-
tions.  To  limit  the  duration  in  which  high  motoric  demands 
were  placed  on  Alexa,  drill-based  activities  were  provided 
within  5-min  blocks.  Throughout  therapy,  traditional  modifi-
cations  for  providing  a  positive  and  supportive  speaking 
environment  when  talking  with  children  who  stutter  were 
intentionally  utilized  (i.e.,  the  clinician  spoke  at  a  slow– 
normal  speech  rate,  limiting  requests  for  on-demand  talk-
than 
ing,  and  providing  more  positive 
likelihood  that 
requests  to  correct,  etc.)  to  minimize  the 
treatment  demands  would  negatively 
impact  her  feelings 
about  communication  or  stuttering  severity.  Overall,  the 
treatment  did  not  increase  her  stuttering  severity  or  nega-
tively 
impact  her  attitudes  towards  her  communication. 
Following  10  months  of  therapy,  Alexa  improved  her  pro-
duction  of  sibilants  at  the  word  level  and  continued  to  be 
progressing  with  generalizing  her  improved  speech  sound 
skills  within  conversations.  This  timeline  of  enrollment  in 
therapy  is  consistent  with  findings  from  the  work  of  Overby 
et  al.  (2022)  that  the  most  common  duration  of  therapy  for 
lateralized  lips  was  12–13  months.

This  case  study  exemplifies  the  importance  of  indi-
vidualized  treatment  planning.  Alexa  was  provided  multi-
ple  evidence-based  treatment  strategies,  yet  not  all  were 
lateralized  errors.  For 
successful 
example,  neither  the  commonly  used  “lazy  t”  method  nor 
nonsense  words  (i.e.,  nonwords)  were  found  to  be  facili-
tative  despite  empirical  and  experiential  support.  Addi-
tionally,  other  children  may  require  more  direct  therapy 
relative  to  stuttering  than  what  was  deemed  necessary  for 
Alexa  and  additional  treatment  considerations  may  be 
appropriate. 

SLPs  are  encouraged  to  consider  the  described  treat-
ment  options  when  tailoring  treatment  to  individual  chil-
dren  who  stutter  who  present  with  articulation  errors.  By 
taking  a  communication-based  approach  that  targets  what 
impacting  the  child’s  communication  and  daily 
is  most 
participation,  preemptively  planning  treatment  modifica-
tions  to  reduce  potential 
interactions  between  treatment 
demands  and  the  child’s  ease  and  willingness  to  communi-
the  child’s 
cate  and  making  modifications  based  on 
response  and  performance,  SLPs  can  successfully  support 
the  child’s  communication  development.
