Covert Stuttering: Investigation
of the Paradigm Shift From Covertly
Stuttering to Overtly Stuttering

Jill E. Douglass,a Maria Schwab,b and Jacqueline Alvaradoa

Purpose: Covert stuttering is a type of stuttering experience
that occurs when a person who stutters conceals his or
her stutter from others, attempting to be perceived as a
nonstuttering individual. A person who covertly stutters
experiences the cognitive and emotional elements of stuttering
with minimum overt behavioral symptoms. Individuals
who covertly stutter are able to provide insight into their
experiences in attempting to be perceived as nonstuttering
individuals. Covert stuttering is a topic that continues to be
in need of a formal definition. The current investigation is
utilizing thematic analysis to provide a detail-rich investigation
of the paradigm shift from covertly stuttering to overtly
stuttering.
Method: The current investigation is a qualitative analysis
of individuals’ transition process from covertly stuttering
to overtly stuttering. Real-time video interviews were
conducted with the use of open-ended phenomenological

interview questions. Interviews were transcribed, and
thematic analysis of interview transcripts was conducted
to investigate the covertly to overtly stuttering process for
participants.
Results: The findings provide insight into a paradigm shift
that occurs when individuals who covertly stutter begin to
outwardly identify themselves and allow for overt stuttering.
The primary theme was a paradigm shift in the 6 participants’
mindset regarding stuttering; additional details are provided
in the subthemes: attending speech therapy, meeting other
people who stutter, and a psychological low point. The
details of the covert-to-overt stuttering conversion are
documented with the use of direct quotations.
Conclusion: The evidence suggests the various intricacies
of the experiences of persons who are covert. Clinical
implications of these findings for assessing and treating
individuals who covertly stutter are discussed.

T he Encyclopedia of Communication Sciences and

Disorders (J. Douglass, in press) provides a working
definition of covert stuttering as the disproportion-
ate use of secondary behaviors to hide a stutter. The com-
mon understanding is with the increased awareness of a
primary stutter (i.e., the core behaviors) comes the likelihood
of an escape response of attempting to cope with the discom-
fort of the stutter. The discomfort of the stutter may come
in the form of a negative listener response (e.g., teasing),
sensing tension of the listener (e.g., body language of others),
feeling of physical discomfort within self (e.g., articulatory
tension), or the loss of control of speech (Perkins, 1990).
With discomfort before, during, or after the moment of

stuttering, the individual who stutters may create an escape
behavior. These escape behavior responses are known under
different terms but are all similar in meaning. These include
secondary behaviors, accessory behaviors, escape behaviors,
and coping behaviors (Manning & DiLollo, 2017).

Early escape or secondary behaviors come in many

forms, all of which are dependent on the individual. These
may include using verbal starters (e.g., “um…”), creating
distracting noises (e.g., clicking the tongue), abandoning the
stuttered utterance, or a physical response (e.g., blinking
eyes, moving the head, writhing the hands). With the per-
sistent accumulation of experiences and the increasing level
of discomfort with stuttering, persons who stutter (PWS)
have an increase in avoidances, anxiety, and frustrations
(Bloodstein & Bernstein Ratner, 2008; Manning & DiLollo,
2017; Tran, Blumgart, & Craig, 2011) as well as a greater
impact on the individual’s freedom of verbal expression. For
example, individuals who are attempting to hide their stutter
may take on personality traits that are not true to them-
selves (e.g., acting “flakey”) to avoid a moment of stuttering
or be identified as a person who stutters (Bleek et al., 2012).

quiring the development of a foundation rich with details
and a descriptive understanding of the covert stuttering ex-
perience, which is best found via qualitative inquiry. For
larger studies to develop, the literature must guide our stra-
tegic development of the most appropriate research questions
via rich description (Damico & Simmons-Mackie, 2003).
In addition, individuals who are covert are in hiding, passing
in society (Goffman, 1986) as fluent. Unless an individual
begins identifying as a person who stutters or in any way is
seeking help, the general population of persons who covertly
stutter (PWCS) is quite a challenge to recruit as research
participants. Finding qualified participants who identify
as someone who was formerly covert allows for a greater
number of participants.

The J. Douglass (2011) study was the first to provide
qualitative evidence describing how six individuals who were
previously covert describe their experience with covert
stuttering. In addition, the study provided insight into the
paradigm shift participants made when they went through
a mental shift in their way of thinking about stuttering,
which led them from covertly stuttering to overtly stuttering.

the participants’ workplace experiences. In an effort to
save face and maintain one’s professional reputation, indi-
viduals justified using covert strategies in the workplace.
These strategies often impacted work performance and
overall personal experience in the workplace (J. Douglass
& Tetnowski, 2015).

Today, the topic of covert stuttering has gained traction
within the stuttering community. These grassroots efforts
are noted via podcasts (e.g., stuttertalk.com; Stutter Talk,
n.d.), blogs (e.g., Stutter Rockstar, n.d.), comics (e.g.,
stutteringiscool.com; Stuttering is Cool, n.d.), and stut-
tering support groups (e.g., National Stuttering Associa-
tion [NSA], n.d.; Friends, n.d.).

The most recent empirical research publication on
covert stuttering (Constantino, Manning, & Nordstrom,
2017) identifies an element of the complexity of covert stut-
tering by theoretically delving into the concepts of “tech-
nologies of communication” used by PWCS. The in-depth
philosophical research validates the “active manipulations”
of the speaking situation and their speech that ultimately
aids individuals who stutter to take on the identity of a
fluent person (Constantino et al., 2017).

Covert Stuttering

Anxiety and Stuttering

In Bloodstein and Bernstein Ratner’s (2008) seminal

text The Handbook on Stuttering, the researchers make
passing reference of the limited understanding of covert
stuttering when they remark in a footnote that covert stut-
tering is “a well-recognized clinical phenomenon with sparse
research documentation” (p. 2). The earliest researchers of
covert stuttering discuss it as “interiorized stammering” with
individuals being in a state of “constancy,” that is, being
constantly aware of speech, surroundings, audience, word
choice, self, and so forth (E. Douglass & Quarrington, 1952).
Perkins (1990) acknowledges covert stuttering once in his
article defining stuttering and considers the negative impact
of listener perception evaluations of stuttering for covert
stuttering. As part of the clinical observations of covert
stuttering by Murphy, Quesal, and Gulker (2007), the
grounds were laid for PWCS to receive stuttering therapy
based on the potential severe psychological, emotional,
and social impact their stutter may have on the individual.

The J. Douglass (2011) study documented the narratives
of six individuals who identified themselves as former PWCS
who, at the time of the investigation, were deemed to for-
merly be PWCS and socially identified as PWS. The findings
indicated six major themes that connected the narratives of
the six participants. They included (a) justifying covert status,
(b) feelings related to overtly stuttering, (c) realization that
hiding is unproductive, (d) a changing event that leads to
transition, (e) empowering experiences that aid in overcoming
covert ways, and (f) commitment to change. The dissertation
was the first to empirically document the transition of an
individual from covert stuttering to overt stuttering.

J. Douglass and Tetnowski (2015) investigated further
into the J. Douglass (2011) study. Their new study revealed
how the mental constancy of covert stuttering impacted

Fear and anxiety stimulate coping behaviors to re-

spond to threats appropriately; however, fear and anxiety
also have the ability to disrupt functioning. A disruption
in the functioning of the speech motor system may disrupt
speech processing and adaptive behaviors (Alm & Risberg,
2007; Attanasio, 2000; Folkman & Lazarus, 1988; Neilson
& Neilson, 1987; Scherer, 1994). The levels of anxiety in
adult PWS are significantly elevated in comparison with
the anxiety in nonstuttering groups (Craig & Tran, 2014).
Reportedly, anxiety potentially increases stuttering frequency
and the likelihood of maladaptive coping, and PWS may
experience negative emotional reactions socially because
of anticipated embarrassment; further research is warranted
to suggest generalizability (Attanasio, 2000).

As previously stated, the accumulation of these nega-

tive experiences and emotional reactions often leads to
an increase in anxiety and avoidance of social settings
(Bloodstein & Bernstein Ratner, 2008; Craig & Tran, 2006;
Manning & DiLollo, 2017; Tran et al., 2011). Negative
life experiences, including stuttering-related bullying, may
impact employment-seeking outcomes and self-perception
and may have an overall impact on one’s personality (Bleek
et al., 2012; Craig & Calver, 1991; Davis, Howell, & Cooke,
2002; Klein & Hood, 2004; McAllister, Collier, & Shepstone,
2012; Van Borsel, Brepoels, & De Coene, 2011). Evidence sug-
gests that stuttering treatments promoting self-efficacy and
support groups positively influence anxiety, mood states, resil-
ience, and social affiliation (Craig, Blumgart, & Tran, 2011).

Concealment

Marginalized populations have the risk of concealing

their difference, potentially due to shame, stigma, societal

An individual who attempts to conceal his or her difference
is, to some extent, self-perpetuating a stigma, giving in to
the societal misunderstanding of a difference that he or she
has (Boyle & Fearon, 2018; Goffman, 1986). Shame and
the response of concealment can decrease with diversity
education to raise awareness of the differences and a com-
munity support system (e.g., diversity training, diversity
campaigns; Griffith & Hebl, 2002).

The predominant concealment discussion is seen

in the literature of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,
and/or queer population. The lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans-
gender, and/or queer literature is currently used to benefit
the understanding of other populations with nonvisible dis-
abilities. “Coming out of the closet” has been referred to as
a process that persons with epilepsy (Schneider & Conrad,
1980), persons with disabilities (Samuels, 2003), and persons
with psychiatric disorders (Corrigan & Matthews, 2003)
may experience.

Purpose

Research on the perspective of individuals who co-
vertly stutter is warranted to further expand the literature
base and provide appropriate clinical interventions and
clinician training. The current study will contribute to
the few systematic investigations of covert stuttering (e.g.,
Constantino et al., 2017) and continue to develop the clini-
cal definition of covert stuttering with the use of evidence-
based research findings.

The purpose of the study is to investigate and develop

a detailed understanding of the transition process of individ-
uals who transition from covert stuttering to overt stuttering.

Method
Participants

The current study included five participants all over
the age of 18 years (three male and two female) who self-
reported a shift from covertly stuttering to overtly stuttering.
The five participants included, under pseudonym, Annette,
Bonnie, Chris, Doug, and Frank; descriptions of partici-
pants and their interview times are found in Table 1. Par-
ticipant recruitment study was by word of mouth through
the stuttering support group community. The selection pro-
cess included participants verbally acknowledging that they

Table 1. Participant description.

were once covert and now consider themselves overt with
their stuttering. Because of the small sample size, the findings
form the framework for further understanding of this under-
represented population. In addition, all participants were
at some point actively involved in the NSA support groups
and/or national conferences.

Procedure

In accordance with the University of Louisiana at
Lafayette and Sacred Heart University’s institutional review
boards, research approval was granted. In addition, confi-
dentiality was maintained in accordance with the guidelines
and regulations provided by the institutional review board’s
standards. As a way of observing confidentiality, names
of all participants were changed including online identities
(e.g., personal blogs), which may reveal a participant’s iden-
tity, and they were given acknowledgment without stating
the specific online name. Likewise, all dates of interviews
are noted by the month and year rather than the exact date.

Six audio-recorded interviews were conducted via

Skype with the first author, and participant follow-up with
the investigator was offered if the participant or investigator
deemed it necessary. One participant e-mailed the investi-
gator postinterview with additional information, which was
considered within the data. The semistructured ethnographic
interviews included open-ended questions (e.g., “Tell me
about your stuttering.”) and a loosely guided plan (e.g.,
“Describe your earliest memory of your speech,” “Expand
on those covert behaviors that you mentioned”), focusing
on the broad question of their covert stuttering experience
and allowing the participants to guide the details of the
plan. Average interview length was approximately 1 hr
16 min, with a range of 1 hr to 1 hr 30 min (see Table 1).

The audio recordings of interview data were ortho-

graphically transcribed and then reviewed and analyzed with
interpretive phenomenological analysis (Smith & Osborn,
2003). The current authors reviewed the participant narratives
to delve deeper into understanding and revising the purpose,
which was to explore “the transition from covertly to overtly
stuttering.” Use of thematic analysis provided flexibility to
explore the details of the transition, which developed into
the specific theme regarding a paradigm shift from covertly
to overtly stuttering that was woven as a consistent under-
pinning to the narratives, although the theme did not take
up large portions of the transcripts.

use of a number of techniques. To ensure reliability, all of
the authors maintained a consistency of the approach via
reading, understanding, and discussing the Smith and
Osborn (2003) chapter regarding interpretive phenomeno-
logical analysis and thematic procedures. The authors
reflected upon and discussed any biases they had or felt while
first reading the transcripts; these biases were acknowledged
and documented to ensure biases were clear before continu-
ing the data analysis. The authors consistently checked
the transcript for accuracy of the audio recordings. Regular
meetings were held between the three authors who indepen-
dently coded the transcripts and then came together to ensure
the interpretation and meaning of the coding was main-
tained and focused on the “changing event that leads to a
transition” theme. In the final stages of compiling the themes
from the codes, intercoder agreement was conducted by
cross-checking codes and comparing the results that were
independently interpreted. The primary theme and sub-
themes were based on rich, thick description consistent
throughout five of the participants’ narratives; the themes
were based on frequently occurring concepts throughout
the narratives (Creswell, 2014; Damico & Simmons-Mackie,
2003).

Results

Direct quotations from the interview manuscripts

are used to ground the themes in the data; all conclusions
are based on the words of the participants. The data of the
individuals’ narratives are reported through their stream
of consciousness during their interviews, with the linguistic
disfluencies present, enhancing the authenticity of their
responses. The stuttering-like disfluencies are not included
as they were not part of the original (J. Douglass, 2011)
transcripts. Regardless, the purpose of the thematic analy-
sis is content-based and broadly focused (i.e., the message
of the participant) rather than focused on how the partici-
pant spoke.

Theme: Paradigm Shift

The interviews revealed internal and external events
that motivated the participants to change their perception
of their covert stuttering. Five participants reported a para-
digm shift in their way of thinking about stuttering. The
shift was realized for some during the interview while recalling
their past experiences; the paradigm shift was not a pre-
planned question for the interview—it was an organic part
of five participants’ narratives. The main theme of a para-
digm shift was supported by three subthemes: (a) attending
speech-language therapy, (b) meeting other PWS, and
(c) experiencing psychological low point.

Subtheme: Attending Speech Therapy

Two participants, Bonnie and Doug, described their
experiences attending speech therapy and the role the speech
therapy played in their paradigm shift from covertly stuttering

to overtly stuttering. Participants reported the speech
therapy experience was mentally uncomfortable, although
their regular attendance suggested they were ready for
change.

Bonnie shared the positive outcome she experienced

after confronting her fear of overtly stuttering during a
speech-intensive program. The following two quotations
recount Bonnie’s experiences during the program:

I found out about another speech intensive program
when I was there, so I went to that. And that was
a lot of awful experiences wrapped up into one.
Making me do these things I had been trying to hide
for so long and all the things that I feared the most
and, but at the end of it, it was really, like, what
I needed all along. Once I finally let myself, um,
confront my stuttering and let people hear my
stuttering and me, become more comfortable with
my stuttering, then it didn’t seem quite as bad.

Doug reported various negative experiences with

speech therapy before his paradigm shift. Growing up, Doug
avoided revealing his stutter at all costs. During school, he
avoided public speaking and waited to talk until he felt like
he would not stutter. These covert strategies continuously
created awkward situations, eventually leading to Doug
attending speech therapy. The following is a summary of his
positive speech therapy experience that resulted in increased
comfortability with his stutter:

I ended up in the speech therapist’s office and I
remember not wanting to look at the people in the
waiting room and just sitting down and not stuttering.
And I remember [the speech therapist] saying, “It’s
okay you’re allowed to stutter here.” And I remember
him being the first one to say that and I remember
him distinctly saying, “I understand,” and I remember
telling him, “I’ve tried not to stutter my whole life,”
and he said, “I understand.” He was very calm and
I remember him telling me, “You are going to be
not a good communicator you are going to be an
extraordinary communicator. And you already are.”
I remember feeling totally relieved and I remember
for the first time feeling it was going to be okay.

Bonnie and Doug reported positive speech therapy

experiences as part of their paradigm shift from covertly
stuttering to overtly stuttering. It is noted that they both
found the beginning of therapy as a young adult a some-
what confrontational experience.

Subtheme: Meeting Other PWS

Three participants experienced a change in how
they thought about their stutter. Meeting another person
who stutters played a part in their paradigm shift. This
affected their identity, and decreased emotional and cog-
nitive impact of their stutter.

Annette experienced a major unexpected career
change that led her to psychological therapy. During her
time of seeking psychological help, Annette learned about

1238 American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology (cid:129) Vol. 27 (cid:129) 1235–1243 (cid:129) October 2018

Annette faced challenges during these meetings and strug-
gled to adjust to the overt lifestyle. Annette recalls her
experiences during the NSA meetings:

My first couple of [stuttering support group] meetings
were a joke: the first meeting I cried the whole time,
the second meeting I had to leave early. It took me
about six months to say at a meeting that “I stutter,”
and, you know, it took me a while for me to be able
to say that but all of that I think has actually been
a blessing in the covert journey that I’ve been on.
Because I’m not sure if [being fired for stuttering]
hadn’t happened that I’d be where I’m at now.

Bonnie had attended speech therapy growing up but

felt that the therapy did not help her address her covert
ways. When she began college, she realized that stuttering
was holding her back from communicating with others
and entering social situations. Bonnie found out about the
NSA and joined the local support group. Bonnie experi-
enced a paradigm shift during her first encounter with peo-
ple who openly stuttered. She describes how being a part
of this open environment impacted her life:

So I found out about the [stuttering support group]
and I went to that. And I met a bunch of people who
were just, like, crazy open about their stuttering. And
that was the first time I ever really heard anybody
stutter and not really care. They were just so proud
to speak the way they did and it really inspired me
to want to be more like them.

Chris, like Bonnie, had a similar experience in meet-
ing and hearing the experiences of other PWS. He delved
into the stuttering support group and self-education via pod-
casts. His experience is detailed with the following:

And just talking about it and realizing that I’m not
alone, like self-education, like really just changed my
life. Like NSA conferences and [stutter podcasts],
realizing that there’s there’s normal, well-adjusted,
cool people who stutter. It’s not, it’s not any kind of
a…it’s not any kind of a deficiency about who I am. It’s
just something about me that’s challenging, you know?

We see similar experiences between Chris and Doug

in that meeting other PWS changed their stereotype of
other PWS as being “not cool” or somehow not normal.
With much hesitation and numerous attempts at avoiding
meeting other PWS, Doug went to his first support group
meeting for PWS. Doug shares how his stereotype of stut-
tering vanished:

Jack [my speech-language pathologist (SLP)] encouraged
me for a long time to meet other stutterers and I would
not do it. I remember he drove to my house on a
Saturday or a Sunday, this was before the days of cell
phones, so he said, “I’m coming over. Be ready in
half an hour.” I didn’t want to go but he was like,
“You need to do this,” he was not a pushy guy, Jack.
He knew to push me pretty hard on this one after

about a year…. I met stutterers and I realized that
they were really cool people, but I was expecting to
meet people who were not really cool. I was expecting
to meet people that were uncool and I had the
stereotypes in my head that people who stutter are
not hip, are not cool and I met people who I am
still friends with today.

Continuing the subtheme of meeting others and

self-education, Frank had similar experiences to Chris.
Throughout his years in elementary, middle, and high school,
Frank concealed his stutter. Frank experienced his change
in thought toward stuttering during his time as an under-
graduate student. Frank disclosed his stutter to his univer-
sity advisor, and she “was really supportive in it.” Frank
and his advisor discussed potential graduate programs that
focused on stuttering; he chose to pursue a master’s degree
in speech-language pathology. He describes how he felt
during this time:

It took me to the age of 22 to meet another person
who was, you know, like a successful, like, person
who stuttered and it was so neat just to hear them
stutter and it was almost like indirect speech therapy.
I was never a client. But these, these people that I
was around, you know, um, I felt like I did my own
kind of self-therapy with like observational learning,
watching them do the things that they do. Me learning
about speech therapy, learning about stuttering,
applying these techniques that I’m learning to my
stuttering, and I felt like I became my own self.
The theme “meeting other people who stutter” proved

to be a time of an identity shift in the narratives of Bonnie,
Chris, and Doug; their preconceptions about what it means
to be a person who stutters were challenged.

Subtheme: Psychological Low Point

Three participants experienced their paradigm shift
during a personal dark period in their lives resulting in a
psychological low point. Annette began her path to change
after the dramatic firing from her job. Since her firing from
the job was associated with her stuttering, she found her-
self helpless on her covert stuttering journey. The following
recounts her experience:

The guilt of honestly believing that [the firing] was my
fault. I had myself convinced that if I had just told
them that I stuttered they would have understood
and I wouldn’t have been fired. Which, of course,
probably had not been the case. But I was living with
that guilt and that fear of, “oh my god, what am I
going to do? I don’t have a job. I’m not going to have
health insurance in a couple of weeks!” I was in that
dark place. Um, and somehow I am here today and
everything has completely changed. And I think it
probably is, I mean, that moment was definitely my
defining moment.
For most of Annette’s life, she was able to manage

her stuttering until she hit rock bottom when she was fired

Downloaded from: https://pubs.asha.org Michigan State University on 11/10/2025, Terms of Use: https://pubs.asha.org/pubs/rights_and_permissions from her decade-long career position. This defining moment
caused her to make changes in her life and find services
to help with her covert stuttering. Annette attributes that
psychological low point to propelling her toward helping
her develop and with the developments and empowering
experiences she has in her current life.

Similarly, Doug underwent a process of physical and
mental turmoil before his reported paradigm shift. In his
20s, he was experiencing health issues for the first time,
which included insomnia for 48 hr at a time, migraines, and
intense stomach pains. These health issues were occurring
simultaneously with his feeling of losing control of his co-
vert tactics. While Doug was searching for a way out of
his covert lifestyle, he disclosed his stuttering identity to uni-
versity professors who undermined his feelings and dismissed
his reports of stuttering. Doug reached out to a hospital
health phone line that provided a reference to an SLP.
During this search for help, Doug also revealed his struggle
with his stutter to his mother. Doug’s deteriorating health
found him in the emergency room where he received in-
travenous injections to aid his migraines. Despite medical
intervention, the health issues persisted. In desperation, Doug
decided to contact the SLP. He immediately experienced
physical relief from the insomnia, migraines, and stomach
pains after his first meeting with the SLP. Doug spoke of
how he felt during this low point:

Within days of meeting [my SLP] my headaches and
intense stomach pains went away. All that pain just
stopped and I knew immediately that it was because
I was talking about my stuttering. It may not be the
most scientific thing to say but talking about my
stuttering stopped the physical pain and I began
sleeping better.

Chris reported a desire for environmental change,
which allowed him to commit to fully understanding his
stutter. He decided to quit his job and relocate. Chris
describes how he felt during this need for change:

I was so, so miserable at the job that I had and I just
needed to do something. I needed to do something,
you know. Just, like, get out of town. Oh, and then
my girlfriend at two and a half years broke up with
me, too. It’s just like, I just wanted to get out of
town kinda. And I wanted to quit my job.

Chris relocated and researched various types of stut-

tering therapy and chose to attend an intensive therapy
week, which had a multidimensional approach to stuttering
therapy. The psychological low point related to career and
relationships propelled him to change his environment and
address his stuttering.

Discussion

The phenomenological study provides a thorough

investigation and an in-depth thematic analysis of the tran-
sition process from covertly to overtly stuttering. The cur-
rent finding adds to the literature in creating a qualitative

definition of covert stuttering (e.g., E. Douglass & Quarrington,
1952; Constantino et al., 2017), with the description of a
paradigm shift that occurs when an individual is shifting to
a more overt way of stuttering. The paradigm shift theme
and subthemes—(a) attending speech therapy, (b) meeting
other PWS, and (c) psychological low point—document
the changes in the reported social, emotional, cognitive,
and identity impact of covert stuttering.

Stuttering support groups play a significant role as an
intrinsic motivation (Trichon & Tetnowski, 2011) in shifting
from covertly to overtly stuttering. When an individual dis-
criminates or stigmatizes a marginalized group, he or she
is likely to decrease his or her discriminatory beliefs after
making contact with an individual of that marginalized
group (Flynn & St. Louis, 2011; Jones, Lynch, Tenglund,
& Gaertner, 2000). Upon meeting other PWS, individuals
who are covert will experience a paradigm shift if they
have a prior stereotype of stuttering or conceal their own
stutter to avoid the stereotype of stuttering. Individuals
experience a positive regard for self after physically encoun-
tering others who stutter, within a structured environment
such as a stuttering support group.

The successful outcomes of support group attendance
are individualized, depending on what the individual deems
as progress and what he or she deems he or she is capable
of. Participants’ definition of successful participation in the
stuttering support group ranged from showing up and being
present to bonding and engaging with others. Attending
the stuttering support group was a positive part of the
covert-to-overt stuttering process for the participants. A
clinician endorsing his or her client’s attendance at a stut-
tering support group should be mindful of the potential
anticipation and hesitation that may be affiliated with the
idea of support group attendance. As seen in the current
findings, attendance at the stuttering support group meet-
ings initially came with marked hesitations.

The self-stigma and cultural stigma surrounding stut-
tering play a role in the participants’ hesitations in attend-
ing a stuttering support group. Boyle and Fearon (2018)
discuss a self-stigma model created by Corrigan, Rafacz,
and Rusch (2011) as a process of internalizing negative
public beliefs among individuals with stigmatized conditions.
Within this model, individuals are aware of negative public
attitudes, eventually agreeing and applying those perspectives
to themselves. This process may impact psychological well-
being, leading to negative self-perception and avoidance,
as supported by the narratives of the current participants.
Participants noted that they were unenthusiastic about
meeting people who stuttered, with the stereotype that
PWS would be “not cool” and “not hip.” After an initial
meeting took place, participants came to the conclusion
that there are “well-adjusted,” “cool” PWS. Participants
found that stuttering is “not any kind of a deficiency about
who I am… just something about me that’s challenging.”
Anxiety and stuttering are documented in the litera-

ture (Craig & Tran, 2014). The current study reveals the
participants were addressing their anxiety as a part of their
paradigm shift process such as reporting their levels of

experienced leading up to and while meeting other PWS,
and the psychological low point many faced due to the
effects of anxiety. The findings reinforce that anxiety is
intertwined in the overall stuttering experience.

SLPs play an integral role in the process of an indi-

vidual transitioning from covertly stuttering to overtly stut-
tering. Boyle and Fearon (2018) discuss the SLP role in the
reappraisal of life events or situations to encourage self-
efficacy and empowerment. Individuals experiencing high
levels of self-stigma may benefit from regaining a sense
of power and control regarding the ability to manage stress
and helplessness, which often accompany stuttering. Positive
statements made by clinicians during therapy, such as “it’s
okay, you’re allowed to stutter here,” created a sense of
hope. Increased perceptions of personal control over the
helplessness and stress related to stuttering correlate to
lower levels of self-stigma and higher levels of hope, self-
esteem, and self-efficacy (Boyle & Fearon, 2018).

Another component impacting the transition process

from covert to overt stuttering is the clinician’s perspective
and knowledge of stuttering. The background of the clinician
sets a tone for the client’s relationship with their stuttering.
Coalson, Byrd, and Rives (2016) discuss that individuals
who stutter consistently rate clinician competency as a criti-
cal component for successful therapy. Findings of the cur-
rent study suggest a direct relationship between the tone set
by the clinician and how successful speech therapy was, as
perceived by participants.

The findings of the current research regarding the

paradigm shift could be integrated to other marginalized
populations who go through a transition popularly re-
ferred to as “coming out of the closet” (e.g., Corrigan &
Matthews, 2003; Samuels, 2003; Schneider & Conrad,
1980). Albeit, the “closet” part of the reference implies the
analogy of “skeletons in the closet” and suggests that a dark
and shameful side of oneself is being revealed. In addition,
the “coming out” element of the popular term refers to
debutants having their coming out to society at a ball. The
use of the popular term “coming out of the closet” with
stuttering is in need of further review, as the origin of the
term is multifaceted and without a systematic definition of
the reference.

Caveats

As stated previously, each participant was involved

in the stuttering community, specifically the NSA. All of
the participants have experienced being in the majority
as a PWS by attending either stuttering support groups
or the annual NSA conference. The participants have had
prior participation in dialogue about stuttering and identified
with the term “covert stuttering” at NSA conferences. The
NSA conference is attended by hundreds of PWS, a small
fraction of the 1% of the American population who stut-
ter (i.e., approximately three million Americans stutter;
Bloodstein, 1995). The experiences, knowledge, and social
encounters of the study’s participants are atypical and

exceptional in comparison with the general population of
individuals who stutter who do not participate in the stut-
tering community.

Implications

Implications arise from the current study regarding

the vulnerability of PWCS upon entering into speech-
language therapy. The depth and focus on counseling a
PWCS are warranted and are within the scope of the field
of speech-language pathology. Knowledgeable counseling
practices and graduate training in counseling are essential to
provide best services for clients who covertly stutter. On the
basis of the current findings, individuals who are covertly
stuttering are managing high anxiety and significant cogni-
tive impacts before and during their shift from covertly
stuttering to overtly stuttering.

Individuals who are covertly stuttering should seek

the help of a certified SLP. More specifically, individuals
seeking services for covert stuttering symptoms should
refer to online resources such as the American Speech-
Language-Hearing Association website to investigate board-
recognized fluency specialists (asha.org); the Stuttering
Foundation, which is organized by state self-identified flu-
ency specialists (stutteringhelp.org); or clinicians who have
fluency special interest group membership via the American
Speech-Language-Hearing Association. Coalson et al. (2016)
report that most SLPs note discomfort when providing
services to individuals who stutter due to insufficient academic
and clinical preparation in this area, as a student. Locating
a clinician who is board-recognized or self-identified as a
fluency specialist would enhance the individualized therapy
experience for individuals who covertly stutter as the clini-
cian may be more aware of the intricacies of stuttering
(Coalson et al., 2016).

SLPs are encouraged to endorse or develop a local

stuttering support group for individuals who stutter. The
stuttering support group environment is conducive for
engaging with others who overtly stutter, who have overcome
or continue to work through covert stuttering challenges,
develop friendships, increase socialization, and provide
freedom to be themselves. National stuttering support
organizations often provide free resources, guidelines, and
affiliation for creating a stuttering support group chapter
(e.g., NSA, n.d.).

In addition, SLPs should provide their client with
educational information regarding stuttering, increasing
their client’s knowledge base of the topic in general and
specifically to the client’s needs. By doing so, the clinician
is aiding in the client’s autonomy and ability to self-advocate.
In addition to increasing content-based knowledge with
the client, the clinician should provide therapy time to
explore online materials and aid the client in becoming
analytical of free online resources and subscribing to appro-
priate stuttering-focused blogs and podcasts. When the clini-
cian focuses on knowledge and valid resources, the clinician
is investing in his or her client’s needs beyond the allotted
treatment time.

Downloaded from: https://pubs.asha.org Michigan State University on 11/10/2025, Terms of Use: https://pubs.asha.org/pubs/rights_and_permissions The clinician and client should transparently set
therapy goals at the onset of therapy based on assessment
results, client values, and the clinician’s expertise. For a
client to be motivated to attend therapy, the client values
for therapy goals may be the priority. Within therapy,
as the client explores stuttering literature, blogs, podcasts,
and stuttering self-help, the clinician and client should reg-
ularly revisit therapy goals as the client’s self-concept con-
tinues to evolve.

Future Directions

Further studies should base their research on the

current findings that individuals who were once covertly
stuttering went through a paradigm shift as they began
attempting to overtly stutter and identify themselves as a
person who overtly stutters. Appropriate follow-up ques-
tions to consider include investigating the speech-language
pathology experiences of individuals who covertly stutter,
the positive and negative experiences, and the logistics of
the therapy sessions such as the therapeutic approaches
used. In addition, were there common contexts in which
individuals who covertly stuttered had similar covert en-
counters? For example, when or where did an individual
who covertly stuttered first realize he or she stuttered or
first experienced shame in relation to stuttering? Further
investigation of the study’s findings and the continuation
of in-depth thematic investigation of the broad themes
would serve to provide greater insight into covert stutter-
ing and beneficial therapeutic treatment. With the current
research as the basis, application and integration of the
stages of change (Floyd, Zebrowski, & Flamme, 2007) could
be applied to the transition process from covertly to overtly
stuttering.

In addition to broad interviews, further qualitative

research should incorporate mixed methods with measuring
the current impact of stuttering on the participant’s life via
means of a standardized test such as the Overall Assessment
of the Speaker’s Experience of Stuttering (Yaruss & Quesal,
2016). Using the mixed method approach would develop
robust findings with the use of triangulation of data.
