Abstract 
Background:  The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between executive function (EF), stuttering, 
and comorbidity by examining children who stutter (CWS) and children who do not stutter (CWNS) with and without 
comorbid conditions. Data from the National Health Interview Survey were used to examine behavioral manifesta-
tions of EF, such as inattention and self-regulation, in CWS and CWNS.

Results:  Results point to weaker EF in CWS compared to CWNS. Also, having comorbid conditions was also associ-
ated with weaker EF. CWS with comorbidity showed the weakest EF compared to CWNS with and without comorbid-
ity, and CWS without comorbidity. Children with stronger EF showed higher socioemotional competence. A majority 
(60.32%) of CWS had at least one other comorbid condition in addition to stuttering. Boys who stutter were more 
likely to have comorbid conditions compared to girls who stutter.

Conclusion:  Present findings suggest that comorbidity is a common feature in CWS. Stuttering and comorbid condi-
tions negatively impact EF.

Background
Disruptions  in  the  fluent  flow  of  speech  are  a  hallmark 
of stuttering [1]. However, consequences of the disorder 
extend  beyond  speech.  There  is  a  growing  body  of  evi-
dence  pointing  to  deficits  in  cognitive  and  metalinguis-
tic  skills  in  children  who  stutter  [2–5].  CWS  have  been 
reported to show weaker executive function (EF; namely, 
phonological  working  memory  [WM],  attentional  skills

and  inhibitory  control)  relative  to  children  who  do  not 
stutter  [CWNS;  for  a  review  see  6–11],  with  implica-
tions for fluency [12, 13]. EF is the umbrella term used to 
describe the abilities needed to manage and allocate cog-
nitive resources during cognitively challenging activities, 
such as switching between rules or tasks, controlling and 
focusing  attention,  ignoring  distractions,  and  inhibiting 
impulses  [11,  14].  EF  is  fundamental  for  language,  self-
control,  emotional  regulation,  and  goal-oriented  behav-
iors [15–17].

EF in typical development

EF  follows  a  predictable  developmental  timeline  [18], 
emerging in infancy as the ability to direct attention and 
progressing  into  the  complex  abilities  required  for  goal-
oriented behaviors in adulthood [11, 19–21]. EF supports 
language  development  (e.g.,  attention  facilitates  lan-
guage learning), and (phonological) WM supports novel 
vocabulary  acquisition  by  allowing  children  to  attend 
to,  analyze  and  hold  linguistic  representations  and  rules 
over  time  [for  a  review  see  22–27].  In  preschool-  and 
school-age children, stronger WM, attention and inhibi-
tory  control  are  correlated  with  better  expressive  and 
receptive  language  skills  [28–31].  This  association  may 
extend  beyond  childhood,  as  both  children  and  adults 
with  stronger  EF  are  more  successful  in  learning  a  new 
language [32]. The relationship between EF and language 
are  likely  bidirectional.  Language  may  facilitate  EF  per-
formance  by  helping  children  to  construct  representa-
tions by labeling conditions, allowing them to reflect on 
and use rule structures that underlie EF tasks [33, 34]. In 
typically developing children, steeper vocabulary growth 
at  age  3  years  predicts  EF  abilities  at  age  5  years  [25]. 
Higher inhibitory control is associated with greater task 
perseverance among children, and higher EF is positively 
associated  with  vocabulary  [35].  Further  evidence  for 
the  relationship  between  language  and  EF  comes  from 
children’s  self-talk  during  EF  tasks.  Four-  and  10-year 
olds  who  use  self-talk  during  the  Tower  of  London  task 
(a commonly used measure of EF) showed faster perfor-
mance and required a smaller number of moves to com-
pletion [36–38].

EF  skills  are  also  predict  socioemotional  competence 
in typically developing children [18, 39]. EF in preschool 
predicts  social  competence  in  kindergarten  [40].  Chil-
dren  must  use  EF  skills  including  WM  (to  remember 
social norms), inhibition (to suppress socially inappropri-
ate responses), and attention (to direct and sustain focus) 
to regulate behaviors and emotions [14, 41, 42]. Deficits 
in  WM  is  linked  to  inattentive  behavior,  high  impulsiv-
ity,  anxiety  and  depression  in  children  [43–48].  Lower 
inhibitory control is associated with aggressive behavior, 
and lower social skills [18, 45–47, 49]. Notably, stronger 
inhibitory  control,  i.e.,  better  self-regulation,  is  corre-
lated with higher social status (more popular) in children 
[50, 51]. Attentional problems in early childhood are also 
correlated  with  delinquency,  and  problem  conduct  such 
as  aggression  and  antisocial  behaviors  in  adolescence 
[52–54].

EF  is  thought  to  be  foundational  to  academic  perfor-
mance  and  success  [for  a  review  see  55–57].  Children 
must  sustain  attention,  attend  to  important  features 
of  lessons,  avoid  distractions  and  hold  information  in 
memory in the classroom [58]. Perhaps not surprisingly, 

weaker  EF  is  associated  with  lower  academic  progress, 
and lower teacher scores for working hard at school and 
learning skills [18, 35, 45–47, 49, 59]. Reading and writ-
ing skills are also subserved by EF; requiring phonologi-
cal  awareness,  and  the  ability  to  hold,  manipulate,  and 
integrate  visual,  auditory  and  linguistic  information  in 
WM  [11,  16].  Children  with  lower  self-regulation  and 
attentional  problems  show  poorer  reading  and  writing 
abilities [52, 53, 60, 61].

EF components while core to the development of self-
regulation,  socioemotional  competence,  and  academic 
achievement  are  also  crucial  for  fluency  [62,  63].  Typi-
cally  developing  children  and  adults  with  higher  WM 
capacity  produce  more  utterances  and  lower  rates  of 
disfluencies  (e.g.,  part-word  repetitions,  revisions)  dur-
ing  spontaneous  speech  and  reading  compared  to  their 
peers  with  lower  WM  capacity  [63–65].  Conditions  of 
divided attention where participants perform concurrent 
tasks result in higher frequency of repetitions and inter-
jections compared to non-divided attention (e.g., speech 
only) tasks [66]. Similarly, adults and children with lower 
inhibitory control show higher rates of disfluencies (e.g., 
revisions) during production of sentences [67].

In general, measuring EF in young children has proved 
difficult  [68,  69].  The  majority  of  assessments  are  adap-
tations  of  tests  for  adults,  as  such,  children  particularly 
those  in  preschool  or  younger,  may  lack  the  linguistic 
and motoric proficiency required for these tasks, result-
ing in floor effects [for a review see 70, 71]. Further, the 
issue of ecological validity of these assessments, whether 
they  are  able  to  capture  executive  functioning  in  real-
word  situations,  have  been  challenged  [72–74].  The  use 
of validated and normed parent surveys and self-reports, 
such as the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Func-
tion  (BRIEF),  which  measures  the  behavioral  expres-
sion of EF provide a solution to some of these challenges 
[75].  Children’s  behavior  at  home  or  school  provide  set-
tings  for  observing  EF  capacity,  and  there  is  accumulat-
ing evidence that parent and teacher ratings of everyday, 
real-world behaviors in these environments provide eco-
logically valid assessments in children [70, 71]. EF mani-
fests  in  everyday  behaviors  such  as  getting  along  with 
others  (e.g.,  inhibitory  control/socioemotional  regula-
tion),  completing  tasks  (attention/self-regulation),  and 
academic achievement (WM/attention) in both typically 
developing and clinical pediatric populations [71, 76, 77]. 
Deficits in EF are correlated with behaviors such as learn-
ing difficulty, inattentive behavior, poor task completion, 
and  slower  academic  progress  [43–47,  54].  Accordingly, 
questions  on  the  BRIEF  such  as:  “Has  trouble  finishing 
tasks  (chores,  homework,  etc.)”,  “Has  trouble  concen-
trating  on  tasks,  schoolwork,  etc.”,  “Gets  out  of  control 
more than friends”, and “Has trouble getting used to new

situations (classes, groups, friends, etc.)” rated on a Lik-
ert scale (“N” if the behavior is never a problem, “S” if the 
behavior is sometimes a problem, and “O” if the behavior 
is often a problem) offer multiple perspectives on a child’s 
EF.  Other  parent  surveys  and  self-reports  such  as  the 
Child  Behavior  Checklist  [CBCL;  78]  and  Strength  and 
Difficulties  Questionnaire  [SDQ;  79]  also  offer  insights 
into behaviors regulated by EF including socioemotional 
competence. The CBCL includes parent and teacher rat-
ings  (0 = Not  true,  1 = Somewhat  or  sometimes  true,  and 
3 = Very  true  or  Often  True)  on  questions  for  assessing 
challenges in socioemotional development such as “Wor-
rying,  Unhappy  sad,  or  depressed”,  “Doesn’t  get  along 
with other children”, and “Doesn’t know how to have fun, 
acts like a little adult”.

EF and stuttering

Both parent reports and cognitive assessments have been 
used  to  evaluate  EF  in  CWS  and  they  suggest  EF  com-
ponents are depressed in this population [6 for a review 
see 80]. WM underpins the ability to store and manipu-
late  relevant  information  during  complex  tasks,  and  is 
proposed to be critical for fluency [64, 81–83]. Children 
and  adults  who  stutter  show  lower  performance  (more 
errors,  slower  reaction  time)  in  WM  tasks  (e.g.,  non-
word  repetition  [NWR]  and  digit  span  tasks)  compared 
to  CWNS  [e.g.,  84–92].  However,  WM  deficits  may  be 
less evident in CWS during less complex tasks (e.g., 2- vs. 
5-syllable  NWR  tasks),  pointing  to  a  compromised  sys-
tem  unable  to  accommodate  increased  demands  [7,  89, 
93–96].  Research  suggests  a  correlation  between  WM 
capacity,  stuttering  severity,  and  recovery  [8,  97].  Close 
to  stuttering  onset,  CWS  who  eventually  recover  show 
stronger WM compared to CWS who do not recover [8]. 
Additionally, CWS with lower WM capacity (indexed by 
higher error rates on NWR) show more severe stuttering 
compared to CWS with higher WM [97].

Executive  attention  oversees  available  resources  for 
cognitive processes including speech production [98, 99]. 
Both  direct  and  indirect  measurements  suggest  greater 
difficulty  in  managing  attention  for  CWS  compared  to 
CWNS [for a review see 80]. Parent- and teacher-reports 
point to lower attentional flexibility and sustained atten-
tion in CWS [100–102]. These reports are consistent with 
findings  of  slower  response  times  compared  to  CWNS, 
and  a  negative  correlation  between  accuracy  and  speed 
in CWS using direct measures of attention (e.g., Dimen-
sional Card Change Sort, Posner Test of Covert Attention 
Shift)  which  require  target  selection  and  shifting  atten-
tion toward different cues [9, 103, 104]. Weaker attention 
control  is  also  correlated  with  higher  frequency  of  stut-
tering in CWS [105, 106]. Similarly, in adults who stutter 
divided  attention,  i.e.,  managing  concurrent  tasks  (e.g., 

speech and finger tapping), results in higher rates of stut-
tering [107 however, see 108]. Attentional training (using 
flanker  tasks)  have  been  reported  to  reduce  stuttering 
severity  in  CWS  [109].  Notably,  the  link  between  atten-
tion  regulation  and  fluency  may  not  be  specific  to  stut-
tering. In the Felsenfeld, van Beijsterveldt, and Boomsma 
[102]  study,  both  CWS  and  CWNS  with  higher  rates  of 
typical  disfluencies  were  more  likely  to  have  attentional 
issues (based on parent report) compared to CWNS with 
lower  rates  of  typical  disfluencies.  Attentional  control 
may  also  have  implications  for  recovery.  Parents  report 
shorter attention span in both CWS who recovered and 
CWNS compared to CWS with chronic stuttering [110], 
which could signal faster processing speeds or lower lev-
els of perseveration in those who recover.

Inhibitory  control  underpins  self-regulation  and  the 
ability  to  suppress  interfering  stimuli  [62,  111,  112]. 
There  has  been  growing  interest  in  the  development  of 
inhibitory  control  in  CWS  but  findings  have  been  con-
tradictory [for a review see 6]. Some studies using direct 
measures  of  inhibition  (e.g.,  Go/NoGo  tasks)  report 
lower  accuracy  and  slower  reaction  time  in  preschool- 
and  school-age  CWS  compared  to  CWNS  [9,  10,  113, 
114].  However,  others  have  failed  to  find  differences 
(e.g., in the number of correct inhibitions) between CWS 
and CWNS using similar tasks [115]. Findings based on 
parent  reports  have  been  similarly  varied.  While  some 
report  lower  inhibitory  control  and  self-regulation  in 
CWS  relative  to  CWNS  [116,  117],  others  have  found 
similar [85, 118–121] or stronger inhibitory control [122, 
123] in CWS relative to CWNS. Markedly, weaker inhibi-
tory control in CWS is associated with more severe stut-
tering  and  chronicity  [105,  124–126].  It  is  plausible  that 
CWS  with  stronger  inhibitory  control  may  have  greater 
ability to suppress overt expressions of incorrect speech 
programs resulting in lower rates of stuttering or higher 
probability of recovery [127].

EF in other developmental disorders and children 
with comorbid conditions

Deficits  in  EF  are  frequently  reported  in  speech-lan-
guage, and neurodevelopmental disorders such as atten-
tion  deficit  hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD)  and  autistic 
spectrum  disorder  [ASD;  for  a  review  see  24,  128–131]. 
In preschool- and school-age children, specific language 
impairment  (SLI)  is  associated  with  weaker  EF  [WM, 
attention and inhibitory control; 130, 132]. Children with 
ADHD show lower performance (reflected by lower accu-
racy and slower response time) on tasks requiring WM, 
attention  and  inhibitory  control  compared  to  typically 
developing children [128, 133]. The degree of EF deficits 
may vary across disorders. For example, parent-ratings of 

 Choo et al. BMC Psychol           (2020) 8:113 

Page 4 of 19

children  with  reading  disability  suggests  higher  EF  than 
for children with ADHD or ASD [77].

Comorbidity  is  commonly  reported  in  neurodevel-
opmental  disorders,  with  potential  implications  for  EF 
development.  Children  with  comorbid  conditions  show 
more profound EF deficits compared to children without 
comorbidity  [129,  134,  135].  For  example,  children  with 
multiple diagnoses of ADHD and anxiety or conduct dis-
orders  show  slower  completion  time,  higher  error  rates 
and  more  perseveration  on  EF  tasks  (e.g.,  Wisconsin 
Card  Sorting,  Finger  Windows)  which  necessitate  WM, 
attention and inhibitory control, relative to children with 
ADHD  without  comorbidity  [136,  137].  These  findings 
are  consistent  with  parent  reports  [e.g.,  Behavior  Rating 
Inventory  of  Executive  Function  (BRIEF);  75]  of  lower 
EF  in  children  with  comorbidity  compared  to  children 
without comorbidity [134]. It is noteworthy that chronic 
health  conditions  are  also  associated  with  impaired  EF. 
For  example,  children  with  medical  conditions  such  as 
diabetes  and  sickle  cell  anemia  show  significant  impair-
ments  in  attention  and  EF  tasks  compared  to  children 
without those conditions [138].

The prevalence of comorbid conditions, such as learn-
ing  disabilities  and  developmental  delay,  is  higher  for 
CWS  relative  to  CWNS  [139,  140].  In  clinical  cohorts, 
concomitant  language,  speech,  and  behavioral  disorders 
(e.g.,  expressive  language,  receptive  language,  articula-
tion,  phonology,  and  ADHD)  are  commonly  reported 
with  stuttering  [141,  142].  Prior  studies  also  suggest 
higher rates of socioemotional, psychological distress and 
anxiety in CWS compared to CWNS [126, 143–148]. In 
a study of 2,628 CWS, a majority (62.8%) had comorbid 
disorders  [149].  The  most  commonly  reported  comor-
bidity  in  CWS  were  learning  (15.2%),  reading  (8.2%), 
attention  deficit  disorder  (ADD,  5.9%)  and  behavioral 
disorders  [2.4%;  149].  Medical  diseases,  such  as  diabe-
tes, asthma, and sickle cell anemia have also been found 
at  higher  rates  in  CWS  compared  to  CWNS  [149–151]. 
Although CWS commonly show symptoms of other dis-
orders, the intervening role of comorbidity on EF has not 
received as much attention. It is plausible that similar to 
children with other developmental disorders, CWS with 
comorbidity  would  show  weaker  EF  compared  to  those 
without comorbidity.

Present study

Findings  related  to  EF  in  CWS  have  been  ambivalent 
[see  6,  80].  Variability  across  studies  may  be  a  function 
of  the  tasks  employed.  CWS  may  perform  within  norm 
or  equivalently  to  CWNS  in  less  complex  tasks  (e.g., 
2-string forward digit span) but show lower performance 
in more complex EF tasks (e.g. Dimensional Change Card 
Sort,  backward  digit  span).  In  other  words,  deficits  in 

EF (as a function of impairment or developmental time-
line) may not be evident unless the system is sufficiently 
taxed;  for  example,  involve  EF  domains  which  have  not 
fully  developed  (attentional  control  in  3-year  olds),  or 
necessitate  manipulation  or  transformation  of  informa-
tion  (e.g.,  Backward  Digit  Span).  Findings  from  a  study 
examining  performance  accuracy  across  multiple  EF 
tasks  in  602  typically  developing  preschool  children 
between 3 and 6 years may shed some insight on ambiva-
lent reports in CWS [152]. Carlson [152] found that per-
formance  was  dependent  on  task  complexity,  whereby, 
outcomes (i.e., behavioral accuracy) were similar for tasks 
with  equivalent  levels  of  difficulty  regardless  of  the  task 
design  (e.g.,  requiring  a  motor  or  verbal  response).  For 
example,  4-year  olds  show  comparable  accuracy  on  two 
tasks  with  equivalent  complexity  levels  which  tap  into 
different EF domains: Whisper (inhibition: children must 
inhibit  from  shouting  out  names  of  cartoon  characters 
but instead whisper them), and Motor Sequencing [WM: 
imitate sequence of pressing keyboard from left to right 
with  index  finger  as  fast  as  possible  before  the  experi-
menter  says  “Stop”;  152].  However,  these  same  4-year 
olds  showed  poorer  performance  on  the  more  complex 
Day/Night  task  where  children  must  suppress  the  pre-
potent  response,  recall  the  correct  answer,  and  generate 
a  new  response  which  conflicts  with  the  dominant  (say 
“night” for the sun picture, and “day” for moon picture). 
Tasks which tap into multiple EF domains (e.g., Dimen-
sional Change Card Sort and Backward Digit Span which 
require both WM and inhibitory control) were found to 
be  more  difficult  [152].  Collectively,  these  findings  sug-
gest  comparing  across  studies  utilizing  disparate  tasks 
will  likely  result  in  ambivalent  findings.  Studies  which 
employ  less  demanding  tasks  may  lack  the  sensitivity  to 
detect EF differences between CWS and CWNS.

Notably, a study by Ntourou, Anderson and Wagovich 
[153] reported better sensitivity for detecting differences 
in EF between CWS and CWNS using an indirect meas-
ure,  i.e.,  the  BRIEF  parent  report  [75].  CWS  received 
lower  parent  ratings  for  WM,  inhibitory  control,  and 
attentional  control  compared  to  CWNS  [153].  Further, 
the  likelihood  of  CWS  meeting  the  clinically  significant 
criteria for EF difficulties were 2.5 to 7 times higher than 
for  CWNS.  CWS  also  received  particularly  low  ratings 
on  questions  related  to  behaviors  involving  a  combina-
tion of WM, inhibitory control/self-regulation and atten-
tion: “Has trouble finishing tasks such as games, puzzles, 
pretend  play  activities”,  “Reacts  more  strongly  to  situa-
tions than other children”, and “Resists change of routine, 
food,  places,  etc.”.  In  contrast,  a  direct  behavioral  meas-
ure,  Head–Toes–Knees–Shoulders  (HKTS—which  also 
involves WM, inhibitory control and attention) failed to 
detect  differences  between  CWS  and  CWNS.  Findings

from  this  study  point  to  the  validity  and  sensitivity  of 
behavioral manifestations to detect EF deficits in CWS.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship 
between  EF,  stuttering,  and  comorbidity  by  examining 
CWS and CWNS with and without comorbid conditions. 
To  do  this,  we  examined  behaviors  (such  as  inattention, 
self-regulation including emotional and social regulation, 
and  task  completion)  underpinned  by  or  closely  associ-
ated  with  EF  using  a  population-based  data.  Based  on 
previous  findings  in  CWS  and  CWNS,  we  hypothesize 
that: (1) CWS will show weaker EF compared to CWNS, 
(2) children with comorbid conditions will show weaker 
EF  compared  to  children  without  comorbid  conditions, 
and  (3)  children  with  stronger  EF  will  also  show  higher 
socioemotional  competence  compared  to  children  with 
weaker EF.

Methods
Sample

Data  was  accessed  from  the  National  Health  Interview 
Survey  (NHIS)  from  years  2006–2018.  The  NHIS  is  a 
nationally  administered  cross-sectional  survey,  con-
ducted  by  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Preven-
tion  (CDC)  to  monitor  the  health  of  the  U.S.,  including 
trends  in  illness  and  disabilities  [154].  The  survey  has 
been  administered  annually  since  1957,  providing  a 
nationally  representative  sample  of  households  in  all  50 
states and the District of Columbia. For each household, 
data was collected from a randomly selected sample adult 
and  child.  Information  about  the  child  was  collected 
from an adult, typically the parent or guardian. Data was 
collected  face-to-face  by  trained  interviewers  who  read 
questions on the survey to interviewees. Some segments 
of  the  population  were  excluded  including  U.S.  citizens 
not  residing  in  the  country,  active  duty  military  per-
sonnel,  incarcerated  inmates,  and  long-term  care  facil-
ity  patients.  A  total  of  119,983  children  (girls = 58,150; 
boys = 61,833) were sampled between 2006 and 2018.

Identification of CWS and CWNS

CWS  were  identified  with  a  positive  parent  response, 
“Yes”,  to  the  question  “During  the  past  12  months,  has 
 [SC1]  had  any  of  the  following  conditions:  Stuttering 
or  stammering”.  Other  possible  responses  were:  “No”, 
“Refused”,  “Not  ascertained”  or  “Don’t  know”.  CWNS 
were  identified  by  a  “No”  response  to  “Stuttering  or 
stammering”.

Comorbidity.  CWS  and  CWNS  were  further  distin-
guished into groups with and without comorbidity based 
on  parent  report.  Children  with  one  or  more  comorbid 
conditions  were  identified  as  CWS-WC  and  CWNS-
WC.  Whereas  CWS  and  CWNS  without  any  comorbid 
condition  were  grouped  as  CWS-NC  and  CWNS-NC 

respectively.  Comorbidity  was  determined  by  a  “Yes” 
response by parents to one or more of the following ques-
tions: “Has a doctor or health professional ever told you 
that  [SC1]  had  _____”  related  to  (1)  “Attention  Deficit 
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or Attention Deficit Dis-
order (ADD)”, (2) “Down syndrome”, (3) “Cerebral palsy”, 
(4)  “muscular  dystrophy”,  (5)  “Cystic  fibrosis”,  (6)  “Sickle 
cell  anemia”,  (7)  “Autism”2,  (8)  “Diabetes”,  (9)  “Ever  told 
SC  had  arthritis”,  (10)  “Congenital  heart  disease”,  (11) 
“Other  heart  condition”,  and  (12)  “Asthma”.  Other  pos-
sible  responses  to  these  questions  were:  “Refused”,  “Not 
ascertained” or “Don’t know”.

EF

EF  was  identified  on  the  basis  of  parent  responses  to 
the  following  questions:  (1)  “Well  behaved/does  what 
requested,  past  6  m”3,  (2)  “Good  attention/completes 
chores,  homework,  past  6  m”4,  and  (3)  “Difficulties  w/
emotions/concentration/behavior/getting  along” 
(see 
Table 1). For questions 1 and 2, possible responses were 
“Not  true”,  “Somewhat  true”,  “Certainly  true”,  “Refused”, 
“Not  ascertained”,  or  “Don’t  know”.  For  question  3,  pos-
sible  responses  were  “No”,  “Yes,  minor  difficulties”,  “Yes, 
definite  difficulties”,  “Yes,  severe  difficulties”,  “Refused”, 
“Not  ascertained”  or  “Don’t  know”.  Responses  that  did 
not  provide  estimates  of  EF,  i.e.,  “Refused”,  “Not  ascer-
tained”  or  “Don’t  know”  were  excluded  from  the  analy-
sis.  Other  responses  were  assigned  scores  to  reflect  the 
level of executive functioning. For questions (1) and (2), 
responses  were  assigned  the  following  scores:  1 = “Not 
true”, 2 = “Somewhat true”, 3 = “Certainly true”. For ques-
tion  (3),  responses  were  assigned  the  following  scores: 
1 = “Yes, severe difficulties”, 2 = “Yes, definite difficulties”, 
3 = “Yes,  minor  difficulties”,  and  4 = “No”.  An  aggregate 
score  with  a  maximum  value  of  10  (high  EF)  and  mini-
mum value of 3 (low EF) based on these questions were 
used in the analyses.

Socioemotional competence

To  determine  whether  socioemotional  competence  was 
also correlated with EF as previously reported in typically 
developing children, responses to the following questions 
were  included  in  the  analysis:  (1)  “Many  worries/often 
seems  worried,  past  6  m”,  (2)  “Unhappy/depressed/tear-
ful,  past  6  m”,  and  (3)  “Gets  along  better  w/adults  than 

1  SC refers to selected child.
2  After  2010,  this  question  was  reworded  to  “Ever  told  SC  had  autism/
autism  spectrum  disorder”,  and  from  2014  onwards  this  question  was 
reworded to “Ever told SC had autism, Asperger’s, pervasive developmental 
disorder or autism spectrum disorder”.
3  Question 1 was not available for the 2008 and 2009 surveys.
4  Question 2 was not available for the 2008 and 2009 surveys.

did not provide estimates of socioemotional competence, 
i.e.,  “Refused”,  “Not  ascertained”  or  “Don’t  know”  were 
excluded from the analysis. Other responses were scored: 
3 = “Not  true”,  2 = “Somewhat  true”,  1 = “Certainly  true”. 
A  composite  score  with  a  maximum  of  9  (high  soci-

possible.

Data analyses

To  combine  the  NHIS  data  from  2006  to  2018,  we 
adjusted the weights and stratum according to the NHIS 
guidelines.  Descriptive  statistics  based  on  the  sample 
population,  using  SPSS  version  25  [156],  were  used  to 
describe  the  distribution  of  stuttering  and  comorbidity 
across group and sex. Subsequent regression analyses to 
test  the  three  hypotheses  were  conducted  with  Mplus 
8.0 [157], accounting for complex sampling design of the 
NHIS so that results are representative of the US popu-
lation.  For  hypothesis  1  and  2,  the  dependent  variable 
was EF, and for hypothesis 3 the dependent variable was 
socioemotional  competence.  The  predictors  included

comorbid  status  (0  without  comorbidity,  1  with  comor-
bidity), and sex (0 if male, 1 if female).

Results
Prevalence of stuttering and comorbid conditions
A  total  of  2258  CWS  (girls = 638,  boys = 1620),  and 
117,725  CWNS  (girls = 57,512;  boys = 60,213)  aged 
between 3 and 17 years were identified in the sample. The 
overall  prevalence  of  stuttering  was  1.88%  with  a  male-
to-female  ratio  of  2.54:1  (Table  3).  There  was  a  higher 
prevalence of stuttering (4.19%) and male-to-female ratio 
(2.86:1)  for  children  with  comorbid  conditions  relative 
to  children  without  comorbid  conditions  (1.02%;  2.14:1; 
Table  3).  A  majority  (60.32%)  of  CWS  had  at  least  one 
other comorbid condition in addition to stuttering com-
pared to CNWS where less than a third (26.44%) had one 
or more conditions.

For both CWS and CWNS, ADHD, asthma and autism 
were  the  most  prevalent  comorbid  conditions  (Table  4). 
Across both groups, rates of comorbidity were higher for 
males compared to females.

EF was lower in CWS compared to CWNS, children with 
comorbid conditions relative to children without comor-
bidity, and boys compared to girls.

Table  6  summarizes  the  results  of  the  regression 
analysis  with  EF  as  the  dependent  variable.  As  shown 
in Model 1, stuttering was a significant predictor of EF 

(B = −  1.195,  p < .001).  EF  was  significantly  lower  for 
CWS  compared  to  CWNS,  supporting  Hypothesis  1—
CWS will show weaker EF compared to CWNS.

As  shown  in  Model  2,  comorbid  conditions  was  also 
a  significant  predictor  of  EF  (B = −  0.950,  p < .001). 
The  EF  for  children  with  comorbidity  was  signifi-
cantly  lower  than  for  children  without  comorbidity,

supporting  Hypothesis  2—Children  with  comorbid-
ity  will  show  lower  EF  compared  to  children  without 
comorbidity.

In  Model  3,  stuttering  and  comorbidity  remained  sig-
nificant  when  entered  concurrently.  Given  the  poten-
tial  differences  in  EF  between  boys  and  girls,  sex  was 
included  in  Model  4.  Females  had  slightly  higher  EF 
than  males  (B = 0.201,  p < .001).  In  summary,  Hypoth-
eses 1 (CWS < CWNS) and 2 (with comorbidity < without 
comorbidity) were confirmed (see Table 5).

Prediction of socioemotional competence by EF 
(Hypotheses 3)

Table  7  shows  the  mean  socioemotional  competence 
scores  across  stuttering,  comorbidity  status,  and  sex. 
Socioemotional  competence  was  lower  for  CWS  com-
pared  to  CWNS,  children  with  comorbidity  compared 
to  children  without  comorbidity,  and  girls  compared  to 
boys.

Table 8 summarizes the results of the regression analy-
sis  with  socioemotional  competence  as  the  dependent 
variable.  As  shown  in  Model  1,  children  with  higher  EF 
had  significantly  higher  socioemotional  competence, 
supporting  Hypothesis  3—Children  with  stronger  EF 
will  also  show  higher  socioemotional  competence  com-
pared  children  with  weaker  EF.  When  EF  was  increased 
by  1,  socioemotional  competence  increased  by  0.453 
(β = 0.512, p < .001).

To  control  for  other  relevant  factors,  sex,  stuttering 
status, and comorbidity status were included individu-
ally  (Models  2–4)  and  concurrently  (Model  5)  in  the 
analyses.  As  shown  in  Model  5,  sex  had  a  significant 
(B = −  0.201,  p < .010)  but  small  effect  on  socioemo-
tional competence; scores were slightly higher for males 
than  females.  Stuttering  (B = −  0.694,  p < .001)  and 
comorbidity  (B = −  0.476,  p < .001)  status  had  signifi-
cant  negative  effects  on  socioemotional  competence. 
Socioemotional  competence  score  was  lower  for  CWS 
compared  to  CWNS  (Model  3)  and  lower  for  children

with comorbidity compared to children without comor-
bidity (Model 4).

In  Model  5,  when  all  predictors  were  entered  in  a 
single  step,  EF  remained  statistically  significant.  This 
further  confirmed  hypothesis  3,  i.e.,  children  with 
stronger  EF  will  show  higher  socioemotional  compe-
tence. Stuttering status remained a significant predictor 
(B = −  0.11,  p = .042),  although  the  effect  was  smaller 
than  in  Model  3.  Sex  was  still  significant  (B = .041, 
p < .001),  but  with  a  larger  effect  than  in  Model  2. 
However,  comorbidity  status  was  no  longer  significant 
(B = − 0.019, p = 0.18) after inclusion of the other vari-
ables in the model.

Discussion
The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship 
between  EF,  stuttering,  and  comorbidity.  To  the  best  of 
our  knowledge,  this  is  the  first  study  to  examine  EF  in 
CWS  with  and  without  comorbidity  on  a  large  scale. 
Our findings point to a critical association between stut-
tering,  comorbidity,  and  EF  in  both  CWS  and  CWNS. 
First,  weaker  EF  was  correlated  with  having  stuttering. 
Second, having comorbid conditions was also associated 
with weaker EF. Notably, CWS-WC showed the weakest 
EF among all groups of children. Third, higher socioemo-
tional  competence  was  associated  with  stronger  EF  and 
absence of stuttering. Our study also confirmed expected 
epidemiological  trends  on  a  large  scale. We  present  evi-
dence  for  a  higher  prevalence  of  stuttering  and  higher 
male-to-female ratio in children with comorbidity.

Prevalence of stuttering

The  overall  prevalence  of  stuttering  was  consistent  with 
past reports [for a review see 1, 158–160]. Closer inspec-
tion  of  the  data  indicates  higher  rates  of  stuttering  in 
children  with  comorbidity,  particularly  boys,  compared 
to children without comorbid conditions.

Comorbidity

A majority of CWS had comorbid conditions in the pre-
sent  study,  consistent  with  previous  studies  [e.g.,  161–
163].  Similar  to  past  studies,  ADHD  and  asthma  were 
two of the most frequently reported comorbid condition 
in  CWS  [149,  164,  165].  Interestingly,  ADHD  has  been 
identified  as  a  risk  factor  for  stuttering  [166].  Several 
explanations have been offered to explain the high rates 
of comorbidity with other neurodevelopmental disorders 
in  stuttering.  First,  stuttering  and  other  neurodevelop-
mental  disorders  are  thought  to  share  a  core  deficit  or 
similar risk factors [e.g., ADHD; 167], and as such, CWS 
could be at higher risk for developing other disorders and 
vice  versa  [168].  Second,  stuttering  may  represent  one 
outcome along a continuum of (common or overlapping) 
etiologies  and  disorders,  with  variability  across  severity, 
timing,  and  symptoms  [169];  and  children  with  comor-
bidity  may  represent  a  more  severe  end  of  the  contin-
uum. Alternatively, stuttering may be a distinct disorder 
that negatively impacts development, amplifying suscep-
tibility to other disorders [170].

The high rates of asthma in CWS in the present study 
is  in  agreement  with  past  reports  [143,  149,  151,  171].

In  fact,  another  atopic  disease,  hay  fever,  was  reported 
to correlate with an earlier onset of stuttering and chro-
nicity  [172]. The inflammatory response  associated with 
atopic  diseases  is  thought  to  affect  the  neurocircuitry 
including those involved in speech [172, 173]. Markedly, 
adults  with  asthma  show  atypical  gray  [e.g.,  increased 
gray matter volume in the right superior temporal gyrus; 
174], and white [e.g., lower white matter coherence in the 
inferior  frontal  gyrus;  175]  matter  in  regions  involved 
in  speech  production  and  reported  to  be  affected  in 
stuttering  [176].  Although  the  mechanism  of  causal-
ity  is  unclear,  the  relationship  between  atopic  diseases 
and  stuttering,  suggests  that  research  on  the  impact  of 
childhood  health  outcomes  and  stuttering  is  warranted. 
Overall, the higher rates of comorbid conditions may be 
a  corollary  of  symptoms  that  manifest  more  severely  in 
CWS,  reaching  observable  or  clinical  levels.  In  general, 
screenings and treatment across multiple conditions may 
be necessary in a majority of CWS.

Sex differences

Present  findings  also  point  to  sex  as  a  significant  vari-
able  in  susceptibility  to  stuttering  and  comorbid  condi-
tions. Overall, there was a higher male-to-female ratio of 
stuttering in this sample, a finding in line with the sexu-
ally  dimorphic  nature  of  this  disorder.  This  sex  bias  has 
been  attributed  to  increased  vulnerability  among  males, 
i.e., a lower “stuttering threshold” and/or fewer required 
contributing  factors  to  developing  stuttering,  compared 
to  females  where  greater  loading  is  required  [177,  p. 
21]. Another  proposed explanation  is  that differences in 
cognitive  maturation  and  development  between  sexes 
might  result  in  more  severe  manifestation  of  symptoms 
in  males.  According  to  this  theory,  females  are  equally 
at  risk  for  stuttering,  however,  symptoms  manifest  less 
severely  or  below  clinical  levels  [178].  In  the  current 
study, the male-to-female ratio was higher for CWS-WC 
relative to CWS-NC. This greater sex bias for CWS-WC 
compared  to  CWS-NC  suggests  increased  vulnerabil-
ity for males who stutter. It is worth mentioning that the 
preponderance of affected males is not limited to stutter-
ing.  Other  disorders,  such  as  autism  and  ADHD,  show 
similar trends of greater male susceptibility [179, 180]. It 
has also been suggested, however, that sex differences are 
due to discrepancies in diagnosis. For example, ADHD is 
more likely to be diagnosed in boys [181] and it is unclear 
if this is rooted in differences in ADHD presentation [i.e., 
boys may present in a manner such that diagnosis is more 
likely;  182]  or  actual  differences  in  prevalence  [for  evi-
dence of similar presentation between sexes, for example 
183]. It is beyond the scope of the present paper to deter-
mine the mechanisms underlying this bias, specifically, if 
they are rooted in differences in prevalence or differences 

in  diagnosis.  We  suggest  this  as  a  direction  for  future 
research; understanding the combination of these factors 
would not only inform how stuttering and comorbid dis-
orders manifest, but also translate into optimal treatment 
for each sex.

Predictors of EF

Stuttering,  comorbidity  status,  and  sex  were  found  to 
predict EF scores. Consistent with our hypothesis, CWS 
showed  weaker  EF  compared  to  CWNS  although  the 
magnitude of the difference was relatively small. Specifi-
cally,  CWS  received  lower  parent  ratings  for  statements 
addressing  behaviors  (see  “EF”  section  in  Methods)  that 
necessitate  holistic  EF,  WM,  attention,  and  inhibitory 
control.  Taken  together,  findings  from  the  current  and 
past  studies  suggest  that  weaker  EF  may  be  a  feature  of 
stuttering [e.g., 10, 85, 102].

There is accumulating evidence that EF is mediated by 
a wide network of circuity, with the (pre)frontal cortices 
and basal ganglia playing key roles [for overview see 184–
186]. The (pre)frontal cortex is involved in manipulating 
and  transforming  information  held  in  WM  [187  involv-
ing  Brodmann  area  [BA]  44–47,  188,  189];  inhibiting 
prepotent  behavioral  and  neural  responses,  and  activat-
ing representations in subcortical regions [190, 191]; and 
top-down control of attention, i.e., bias attention to rele-
vant information, and sustaining attention [192–195]. EF 
behaviors  localized  in  the  (pre)frontal  regions  are  mod-
ulated  by  activity  in  the  basal  ganglia,  which  select  and 
enable  executive  programs  [184,  196–199].  These  same 
regions, (pre)frontal cortex and basal ganglia, have been 
found to be aberrant in stuttering [200, 201 for overview 
see 202]. It is highly plausible that EF deficits in CWS are 
related to these structural and functional abnormalities.

In typically developing children, EF components expe-
rience  protracted  development  from  infancy  through 
late  childhood  and  into  early  adulthood  [for  a  review 
see 69, 203]. Although many EF components are present 
in  infancy,  they  grow  exponentially  in  early  childhood 
[16,  26,  55,  97,  204–207].  Children  show  limited  abil-
ity  to  manipulate  or  transform  representations  in  WM 
until  around  age  2  years  [208].  Before  age  4  years,  chil-
dren  perform  below  chance  on  inhibitory  control  tasks 
[e.g.,  Grass/Snow  or  Less  is  More;  152,  209].  The  abil-
ity to sustain and direct attention to relevant stimuli are 
limited until about age 5 years [210, 211]. Presentation of 
neurodevelopmental  disorders  and  stressors  in  early  life 
have  particularly  profound  impact  on  EF  development 
[212, 213]. The developmental timing of stuttering, with 
onset typically around 3 years of age [214], may have dev-
astating effects on EF during this critical period of rapid 
growth.  The  presence  of  stuttering  may  delay,  reduce 
or  plateau  EF  development.  A  longitudinal  study  which 

Choo et al. BMC Psychol           (2020) 8:113 

Page 11 of 19

maps EF growth would be needed to determine specific 
trajectories in CWS.

Previous  studies  have  primarily  focused  on  EF  dif-
ferences  between  CWS  without  comorbidity  and  typi-
cally developing children [85–87, 89]. The present study 
extended  this  focus  to  CWS  and  CWNS  with  comor-
bidity.  Although  the  magnitude  of  difference  between 
groups  were  small,  our  findings  of  weaker  EF  in  CWS 
and  CWNS  with  comorbidity  compared  to  their  peers 
without  comorbid  conditions  is  consistent  with  prior 
reports of weaker EF in children with multiple conditions 
in other neurodevelopmental disorders (see “EF in other 
developmental  disorders  and  children  with  comorbid 
conditions” section).

Nonetheless,  our  finding  of  stronger  EF  in  CWS-NC 
compared  to  CWNS-WC  was  unexpected.  Additionally, 
CWS-WC  showed  the  weakest  EF  amongst  all  groups. 
These  findings  suggest  that  multiple  conditions  have  a 
more robust negative effect on EF than stuttering alone, 
and further widen disparities between CWS and CWNS. 
A  potential  confound  to  understanding  the  effects  of 
comorbidity  is  the  severity  of  conditions,  duration  and 
sequence of appearance. In the present study, it is unclear 
whether stuttering is the core impairment in CWS-WC, 
and  whether  conditions  occurred  sequentially  (and  if 
so,  in  which  order).  Moreover,  the  duration  of  over-
lap  between  conditions  was  not  reported.  It  is  plausible 
that CWS (and for that matter, CWNS) with early onset 
or  longer  duration  of  multiple  diagnoses  would  show 
weaker EF as a consequence of prolonged, increased bur-
den. To gain a better understanding of the possible causal 
influences  and  directionality  of  stuttering,  comorbid-
ity  and  EF,  a  longitudinal  study  mapping  the  sequence, 
timing,  and  duration  of  conditions  in  conjunction  with 
EF  development  along  varying  pathways  to  recovery  or 
chronicity  would  be  necessary.  It  should  be  noted  that 
the  standardized  regression  coefficient  for  comorbid-
ity  was  larger  compared  to  that  for  stuttering. This  sug-
gests that the presence of comorbid conditions may have 
a larger impact on EF development than stuttering alone.
The  present  study  also  found  a  significant  association 
between  sex  and  EF.  When  stuttering  and  comorbidity 
were  controlled  for,  the  EF  for  females  was  larger  than 
the  EF  for  males.  Nonetheless,  the  magnitude  of  differ-
ence  between  sexes  was  small.  In  fact,  the  standardized 
regression coefficient for stuttering was larger compared 
to  that  for  sex.  This  suggests  that  stuttering  may  have  a 
greater  practical  importance  than  sex  in  determining 
EF.  Nonetheless,  prior  research  has  demonstrated  dif-
ferences  between  the  sexes  for  specific  EF  components 
during childhood [215], although differences lessen with 
age  [216]  and  there  is  no  evidence  of  systematic  advan-
tage across the lifespan [for a review see 217]. In general, 

typically  developing  girls  outperform  boys  on  inhibitory 
control and attention [217]. Girls are also less impulsive 
during  childhood  and  show  better  WM  [217],  although 
differences are not observed on tasks of spatial WM [218, 
219].  Additionally,  within-sex  variability  is  likely  greater 
than  between-sex  variability  [217].  The  current  study 
addressed  holistic  EF  measured  through  parent  report 
of behavior; prior research indicates that sex differences 
are sometimes linked to EF task type, such that changing 
task features changes results in turn [217]. As such, find-
ings of sex differences may be related to EF measurement 
in the current study (i.e., parent report of behaviors) and 
should be interpreted with caution.

Predictors of socioemotional competence

EF  was  a  significant  predictor  of  socioemotional  com-
petence,  confirming  our  hypothesis.  The  standardized 
regression coefficient for EF was larger than that for sex 
or  comorbidity  status  pointing  to  the  crucial  contribu-
tion  of  EF  to  socioemotional  development.  Stronger  EF 
was correlated with better socioemotional competence, a 
finding in line with general consensus in the field. Social 
interactions  involve  EF  skills,  including  the  ability  to 
remember  social  norms  (WM),  suppress  socially  inap-
propriate  behaviors  (inhibitory  control),  and  direct  and 
sustain  attention  on  interactions  [14,  18,  220].  Accord-
ingly,  children  with  stronger  EF  would  be  expected  to 
have better socioemotional functioning and more proso-
cial behaviors. Socioemotional competence is a key pre-
dictor  of  social  and  academic  success,  and  challenges 
with socioemotional functioning in early childhood have 
consequences for long-term social, academic success and 
mental  health  [221–223].  Early  socioemotional  compe-
tence in kindergarten is correlated with lower probability 
of mental health issues in adolescence; and higher prob-
ability of graduating from high school, attending college, 
being  employed  in  adulthood  [222,  224].  Conversely, 
lower socioemotional competence in preschool is linked 
to  higher  internalizing  (e.g.,  depressed  mood,  anxiety, 
social  withdrawal)  and  externalizing  (e.g.,  aggression, 
hyperactivity) symptoms in adolescence [225]. It is worth 
noting  that  these  same  challenges  in  social,  academic 
and  mental  health  are  reported  in  those  who  stutter 
[226–228],  and  multifactorial  models  of  stuttering  cite 
emotion  as  a  factor  in  the  emergence  and  chronicity  of 
stuttering [229, 230]. However, the cross-sectional design 
of the current study does not allow for the examination of 
EF changes and related socioemotional competence over 
time  in  CWS.  Moreover,  other  factors  found  to  impact 
socioemotional  status  in  children,  such  as  socioeco-
nomic  status/household  income,  language  minority  sta-
tus and parents’ mental health [224], were not examined 
in  this  study.  A  longitudinal  study  which  encompasses 

 Choo et al. BMC Psychol           (2020) 8:113 

Page 12 of 19

the aforementioned factors would be needed to provide a 
complete picture of socioemotional functioning in CWS.
Sex  was  also  found  to  be  a  significant  predictor  of 
socioemotional  competence.  When  EF,  stuttering,  and 
comorbidity were controlled for, girls were found to have 
lower  socioemotional  competence  than  boys,  although 
the magnitude of difference was small. This suggests that 
the  effects  of  sex  may  be  less  clinically  significant  than 
EF or comorbidity in the development of socioemotional 
competence.  Disparities  in  sex-related  findings  between 
EF  and  socioemotional  competence  may  be  related  to 
differences  in  social-evaluative  concerns,  perceptions 
of  socioemotional  competence  between  sexes,  and  the 
measures of socioemotional competence used in the pre-
sent  study.  Girls  have  been  found  to  show  heightened 
socio-evaluative  concerns  compared  to  boys,  as  well 
as  higher  levels  of  depression  related  to  these  concerns 
[231].  Further,  girls  who  show  lower  socioemotional 
competence exhibit higher externalizing symptoms [232]. 
Traditionally, perceptions of socioemotional competence 
may be impacted by the expected norms for sexes, where 
externalizing  behaviors  such  as  aggression  are  judged 
favorably  in  boys  (i.e.,  aggressive  boys  are  seen  as  more 
socially competent than less aggressive boys) but not girls 
[for  overview  see  233].  These  differences  may  intersect 
with the specific items used in the current study, that is, 
higher  levels  of  depression,  worrying,  and  externalizing 
behaviors among girls may have disproportionate impact 
on parent ratings on the related survey items.

Stuttering was also a significant predictor of socioemo-
tional competence, although the magnitude of effect was 
smaller than for EF or sex. This finding was not surpris-
ing  in  light  of  reports  of  social  and  emotional  difficul-
ties  in  those  who  stutter  [147,  234].  School-aged  CWS 
between  7  and  12  years  old,  particularly  girls,  are  six 
times  more  likely  to  have  social  anxiety  disorder,  and 
seven  times  more  likely  to  have  generalized  anxiety  dis-
order  compared  to  typically  developing  children  [235]. 
An overwhelming majority of CWS experience peer vic-
timization,  difficult  in  establishing  friendships,  negative 
self-perceptions,  shame,  and  lower  self-confidence  with 
consequences for their socioemotional functioning [236–
240]. Collectively, findings point to the burden of stutter-
ing  on  socioemotional  functioning,  particularly  for  girls 
who stutter.

Theoretical implications for EF in stuttering

EF components feature prominently in some causal the-
ories  of  stuttering,  such  as  the  EXPLAN  model,  Covert 
Repair  Hypothesis  and  Vicious  Circle  Hypothesis  [13, 
108,  241–243].  In  the  EXPLAN  model,  the  phonologi-
cal  loop  and  WM  are  involved  in  accessing  phonologi-
cal  information  in  memory,  and  lags  between  linguistic 

planning  and  motor  execution  are  thought  to  produce 
disfluencies  [12,  13,  244].  It  is  conceivable  that  deficits 
in phonological WM (as reflected by lower accuracy and 
slower  response  in  WM  tasks  in  CWS)  could  result  in 
errors in activation or ordering of linguistic material, and 
result  in  linguistic  planning  delays  [12,  245].  The  Cov-
ert Repair Hypothesis proposes that disfluencies are the 
product of covert detection and corrections of prearticu-
latory  errors  which  interfere  with  ongoing  articulation, 
and  higher  rates  of  disfluencies  are  due  to  multiple  or 
excessive attempts at repairs [13]. First, weaker attention 
control  as  reported  in  CWS  [e.g.,  9,  10,  113,  114]  may 
result in excessive attention on prearticulatory errors or 
an  inability  to  shift  attention  away  from  repaired  seg-
ments,  whereby,  numerous  repair  attempts  are  made, 
contributing to high rates of disfluencies. Second, weaker 
inhibitory  control  would  also  prevent  suppression  of 
excessive  corrections  of  speech  plans,  yielding  high 
rates  of  disfluencies  [127].  Similarly,  the  Vicious  Circle 
Hypothesis posits that heightened monitoring and focus 
on speech errors, along with lower threshold for repairs 
underpin  stuttering  [108].  Reports  of  weaker  attention 
control and lower flexibility in CWS [e.g., 100–102] could 
result in abnormal allocation of resources or an inability 
to redirect attention away from error monitoring. These 
theories posit a link between stuttering frequency and EF 
development.  CWS  with  weaker  EF  would  be  predicted 
to  show  higher  frequency  of  stuttering.  These  frame-
works  could  also  be  extended  to  stuttering  prognosis. 
For  children  who  are  experiencing  development  delays 
including  in  EF  domains,  stuttering  may  resolve  as  the 
cognitive system matures and catches up. Delays in pho-
nological access may decrease as WM capacity increases 
[EXPLAN;  12].  As 
inhibitory  control  strengthens, 
attempts  at  repairs  may  decline  [Covert  Repair  Hypoth-
esis;  13],  and  stronger  attention  control  could  reduce 
excessive  monitoring  of  speech  errors  [Vicious  Circle 
Hypothesis; 243].

WM  models  offer  a  unified  framework  for  integrating 
EF components affected in stuttering. The unity/diversity 
theoretical  model  of  EF  proposes  that  underlying  com-
ponents  (WM,  attention,  inhibition)  are  correlated  but 
dissociable [112]. EF holistically results from the interac-
tion  of  these  distinct  domains  with  each  responsible  for 
complimentary  control  [112,  246].  Baddeley  and  Hitch’s 
[247]  three-factor  model  and  more  recently,  Baddeley’s 
[98]  four-factor  model  conceptualize  WM  as  a  storage 
system  for  verbal/auditory  information  (i.e.,  phonologi-
cal  loop),  and  visuo-spatial  information  (i.e.,  visuospa-
tial  sketchpad).  The  phonological  loop  and  visuospatial 
sketchpad  are  overseen  by  an  attention  controller  (i.e., 
central  executive),  and  episodic  buffer  for  integration  of 
material in the phonological and visuospatial subsystems 

Choo et al. BMC Psychol           (2020) 8:113 

Page 13 of 19

[98,  248,  249].  There  is  robust  evidence  which  suggest 
that the WM system (including attention and inhibitory 
control)  is  crucial  for  EF  behavior,  and  deficits  within 
this  system  in  whole  or  within  each  domain,  are  cor-
related  with  behavioral  issues  [43,  250  for  a  review  see 
251]. Thus, the development of EF may related to specific 
behaviors (e.g., self-regulation) in CWS. In other words, 
CWS with behavioral challenges, including those related 
to self- and socioemotional regulation, and attention may 
have weaker EF. Nonetheless, how EF maps onto chronic-
ity  is  unclear.  It  is  plausible  that  CWS  with  EF  deficits, 
reflected  by  behavioral  challenges,  that  do  not  resolve 
with age may have a higher risk for chronicity.

Limitations
The  strengths  of  the  present  study  are  the  large  sample 
sizes  and  avoidance  of  potential  selection  bias  of  sub-
jects  (e.g.,  recruitment  via  clinical  referrals).  Nonethe-
less,  some  limitations  including  the  reliance  on  parent 
report need to be addressed. It is extremely probable that 
stuttering  was  not  formally  diagnosed  in  some  children 
and others were misidentified. Further, parents’ memory 
of  their  child’s  development  including  stuttering  may 
be  inaccurate.  The  heterogeneity  of  stuttering  and  vari-
ability  of  symptoms  over  time  may  also  inflate  the  risk 
of  misidentification,  particularly  for  children  with  mild 
stuttering  or  those  who  may  be  experiencing  periods  of 
increased fluency at the time of the survey interview. EF 
was  also  measured  using  parent  reports.  Although  pre-
vious studies have utilized behavior as a proxy for EF in 
CWS  [e.g.,  100,  102,  116]  and  CWNS  [e.g.,  70,  71,  75]; 
and  found  higher  sensitivity  for  detecting  differences 
between  CWS  and  CWNS  [153],  more  research  is  need 
to determine how parent reports map onto outcomes in 
standardized EF tests for CWS. Stuttering was not opera-
tionally defined in the survey. Thus, CWNS with higher 
rates  of  typical  disfluencies  may  be  misidentified  with 
stuttering. The presence of comorbidity were also based 
on parent reports, and as such may be disproportionately 
(over- or under-) identified. Although parents were asked 
whether “a doctor or health professional ever told” them 
that  their  child  had  specific  conditions,  it  is  unclear  if 
these were based on a formal diagnosis. Additionally, the 
direction  of  effects  or  causality  between  factors  cannot 
be  determined  in  the  current  study.  The  current  study 
included  children  with  a  broad  range  of  comorbid  con-
ditions.  Future  studies  may  benefit  from  examining  the 
impact of specific conditions on EF development.

Conclusion
Findings from the present study points to the validity and 
sensitivity  of  parent  reports  on  real-world  behaviors  as 
a  means  to  measure  EF  in  CWS.  Nonetheless,  it  is  still 

unknown if EF is malleable in CWS, and if so, what are 
the opportunities for remediation, such as targeted train-
ing, and/or authentic activities that support EF develop-
ment [cf. musical training, mindfulness; 252]. Managing 
two  languages  concurrently  is  thought  to  enhance  EF 
components  in  typically  developing  bilinguals  [for  a 
review see 253]. Bilinguals show higher performance for 
tasks  requiring  WM,  attention  and  inhibitory  control 
compared to their monolingual peers [253–255 however, 
see  256].  For  example,  4-year  old  bilinguals  outperform 
their  age-matched  monolingual  peers  in  their  capac-
ity  to  focus  and  switch  attention,  demonstrating  accu-
racy  equivalent  to  5-year  old  monolinguals  during  the 
Dimensional Change Card Sort [257]. It is unclear if this 
bilingual  enhancement  is  affected  in  stuttering.  Under-
standing how stuttering interacts with bilingualism could 
offer insight into the development of EF in CWS.

Current  findings  support  the  presence  of  subtypes 
in  CWS  based  on  EF  and  comorbidity,  i.e.,  CWS  with 
stronger  EF  without  comorbid  conditions,  and  CWS 
with  weaker  EF  with  comorbidity.  These  subtypes  may 
have  relevance  for  chronicity.  Some  children  who  are 
experiencing  developmental  delays,  including  in  cogni-
tive  development,  may  experience  periods  of  stuttering, 
that  is,  until  EF  deficits  resolve  with  maturation  of  the 
cognitive  system.  It  is  possible  that  stronger  EF,  albeit 
weaker  than  in  CWNS,  and  the  absence  comorbidity  in 
CWS  reflect  more  subtle  deficits  which  could  eventu-
ally resolve or attenuate. If so, the probability of recovery 
would  be  higher  for  this  group.  Conversely,  CWS  with 
weaker EF and comorbid conditions may be a subgroup 
with  greater  developmental  vulnerability  and  increased 
risk  for  chronicity.  Weaker  EF  and  comorbidity  may 
simply signal a higher degree of impairment, surpassing 
the  ability  of  the  cognitive  system  to  compensate.  More 
fine-grained  research  is  needed  to  disentangle  the  rela-
tionship  between  EF,  comorbidity,  and  stuttering  prog-
nosis. Present findings also have implications for clinical 
practice. Deficits in EF and high rates of comorbidity in 
CWS underscore the need for multi-dimensional, multi-
domain  approaches  to  the  diagnoses  and  treatment  of 
stuttering.  Such  an  approach  would  better  address  the 
complexity of stuttering, and variability across individu-
als and sex across a wide spectrum of symptoms leading 
to improved outcomes.
